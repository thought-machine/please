""" Rules to build Python code.

The output artifacts for Python rules are .pex files (see https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex).
Pex is a rather nice system for combining Python code and all needed dependencies
(excluding the actual interpreter and possibly some system level bits) into a single file.

The process of compiling pex files can be a little slow when including many large files, as
often happens when one's binary includes large compiled dependencies (eg. numpy...). Hence
we have a fairly elaborate optimisation whereby each python_library rule builds a little
zipfile containing just its sources, and all of those are combined at the end to produce
the final .pex. This builds at roughly the same pace for a clean build of a single target,
but is drastically faster for building many targets with similar dependencies or rebuilding
a target which has only had small changes.

    Note that each python_library performs some pre-zipping of its inputs before they're combined

    of those rules are python_library rules, it's often a good idea to wrap any large dependencies
    in one to improve incrementality (not necessary for pip_library, of course).

    This is a lightweight pip-free alternative to pip_library which supports cross-compiling.
    Rather than leaning on pip which is difficult to achieve reproducible builds with and
    support on different platforms, this rule is a simple wrapper around curl and unzip.
    Unless otherwise specified, the wheels are expected to adhere to common naming schemes,
    such as:
      <package_name>-<version>[-<os>-<arch>].whl
      <package_name>-<version>[-<os>_<arch>].whl
      <package_name>-<version>.whl

    Args:
      name (str): Name of the rule. Also doubles as the name of the package if package_name
            is not set.
      version (str): Version of the package to install.
      hashes (list): List of hashes to verify the package against.
      package_name (str): If given, overrides `name` for the name of the package to look for.
      outs (list): List of output files. Defaults to a directory named the same as `name`.
      post_install_commands (list): Commands to run after 'install'.
      patch (str | list): Patch file to apply after install to fix any upstream code that has
                          done bad things.
      licences (list): Licences that this rule is subject to.
      test_only (bool): If True, this library can only be used by tests.
      repo (str): Repository to download wheels from.
      zip_safe (bool): Flag to indicate whether a pex including this rule will be zip-safe.
      visibility (list): Visibility declaration.
      deps (list): Dependencies of this rule.
      name_scheme (str): The templatized wheel naming scheme (available template variables
                         are `url_base`, `package_name`, `initial`, and `version`).
      strip (list): Files to strip after install. Note that these are done at any level.
