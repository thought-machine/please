This repo is meant to be like a library that is built with Please. We should use some of the config settings from
the host repo, explicitly layering in stuff that's marked to be inherited.

For example if this was a go repo, we'd want to use the GoTool from the host repo. If we didn't we might end up mixing
toolchain versions and therefore we wouldn't be able to link to this library.

In this case, this subrepo defines a FoocTool but we use the FoocTool as defined in the host repo.
