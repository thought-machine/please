# We prefer Ubuntu 17.10 because it makes the installation of some packages simpler
# and is more up-to-date than 16.04.
# If you want to replicate this image on 16.04 the main difference is UnitTest++
# which you'll need to compile your own copy of - their version is too old (we need v2)
# and has some naming idiosyncrasies which are too hard to support).
