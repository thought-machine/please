Please Ubuntu image
-------------------

This image contains everything needed to build Please & associated tools
and run all the tests. It's the canonical supported environment for
normal usage.

It is currently based on Bionic (18.04) but Focal (20.04) should work fine too.
It should be possible to get older versions running in a similar way.
