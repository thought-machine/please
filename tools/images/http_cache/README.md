HTTP cache image
================

This is a very simple image that contains an nginx server usable for the remote
HTTP cache. It isn't a production-ready setup since it never cleans anything up,
it primarily exists as a tool for local testing.

It serves on port 8080 so you will need to expose that from the container.
