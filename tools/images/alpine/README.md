Please Alpine image
-------------------

This image contains everything needed to build Please and its
associated tools. It is fairly minimal and doesn't contain everything
needed to run all of the language-specific tests (see the Ubuntu image
if that is of interest).
This is the canonical build environment for Please in Linux that we
use to release binaries from.
