Alternative Ubuntu image
------------------------

This is a modified version of the normal Ubuntu image with different
OS and package versions. It's not really recommended for normal use
but exists so we can test that things at least work in this environment.

Notable differences:
 - Uses Bionic instead of Artful
 - Go 1.12 (standard one has 1.13)
 - Python 3.6 (standard one has 3.5)
 - Java 9 (still has various issues, standard one uses 8)
