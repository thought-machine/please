LSP
----

It should work the same way as any of our other tools, such as `jarcat`.

command: plz init-lsp
.. or it should just work on installation/bootstrap of plz



main.go
-------
- parse arguments


langserver
----------------
this directory should contain everything about the language server

- jsonRPC
- Responses:
    - result of requests sent by *client*
    - ResponseMessage: id, result, error
    - success: result should be nil

functionalities:
    - completion.go
        - handled completion
    - Analyzer.go
        - analyzes project build_defs
    - Handler.go
        - handles requests
        - should be the same structure as please.go
            - a map for different requests





lsp
-----------------

specs.go
- This file will have all the specification structs
- TODO: Decide if I need to add createFile options


init.go
