please_diff_graphs is a small utility to calculate differences between two Please build graphs.

Its inputs are two JSON graph files (produced using 'plz query graph') and any files that have changed.
It will output a list of all build targets that have changed between the two.
For example:

please_diff_graphs -b before.json -a after.json src/core/my_file.go
> //src/core:my_target
> //src/elsewhere:some_other_target

Note that the 'ordering' of the two graphs matters, hence their labels 'before' and 'after';
the operation is non-commutative because targets that are added appear and those deleted do not.

please_diff_graphs is mostly useful in conjunction with Please in a CI system; you can use it to
formally determine what set of targets have changed in a diff and run the minimal set of affected tests.
