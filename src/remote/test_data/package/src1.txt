I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to
follow my advice without knowing why. It is altogether against my
will that I tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion
of the antarctic - with its vast fossil hunt and its wholesale
boring and melting of the ancient ice caps. And I am the more
reluctant because my warning may be in vain.
