    "accept": "Licences that are accepted in this repository.\n When this is empty licences are ignored. As soon as it's set any licence detected or assigned must be accepted explicitly here.\n There's no fuzzy matching, so some package managers (especially PyPI and Maven, but shockingly not npm which rather nicely uses SPDX) will generate a lot of slightly different spellings of the same thing, which will all have to be accepted here. We'd rather that than trying to 'cleverly' match them which might result in matching the wrong thing.",

    "artool": "The tool invoked to archive static libraries. Defaults to ar.", 
    "asmtool": "The tool invoked as an assembler. Currently only used on OSX for cc_embed_binary rules and so defaults to nasm.", 
    "blacklistdirs": "Directories to blacklist when recursively searching for BUILD files (e.g. when using plz build ... or similar).\n This is generally useful when you have large directories within your repo that don't need to be searched, especially things like node_modules that have come from external package managers.", 
    "buildfilename": "Sets the names that Please uses instead of BUILD for its build files.\n For clarity the documentation refers to them simply as BUILD files but you could reconfigure them here to be something else.\n One case this can be particularly useful is in cases where you have a subdirectory named build on a case-insensitive file system like HFS+.",

    "coverage": "If true (the default), coverage will be available for C and C++ build rules.\n This is still a little experimental but should work for GCC. Right now it does not work for Clang (it likely will in Clang 4.0 which will likely support --fprofile-dir) and so this can be useful to disable it.\n It's also useful in some cases for CI systems etc if you'd prefer to avoid the overhead, since the tests have to be compiled with extra instrumentation and without optimisation.", 
    "cpptool": "The tool invoked to compile C++ code. Defaults to g++ but you might want to set it to clang++, for example.",

    "dircachecleaner": "The binary to use for cleaning the directory cache.\n Defaults to cache_cleaner in the plz install directory.\n Can also be set to the empty string to disable attempting to run it - note that this will of course lead to the dir cache growing without limit which may ruin your day if it fills your disk :)",

    "linkwithldtool": " If true, instructs Please to use the tool set earlier in ldtool to link binaries instead of cctool.\n This is an esoteric setting that most people don't want; a vanilla ld will not perform all steps necessary here (you'll get lots of missing symbol messages from having no libc etc). Generally best to leave this disabled.", 
    "location": "Defines the directory Please is installed into.\n Defaults to ~/.please but you might want it to be somewhere else if you're installing via another method (e.g. the debs and install script still use /opt/please).", 
    "moduledir": "Defines a directory containing modules from which they can be imported at the top level.\n By default this is empty but by convention we define our pip_library rules in third_party/python and set this appropriately. Hence any of those third-party libraries that try something like import six will have it work as they expect, even though it's actually in a different location within the .pex.",
