"""Contains rules for working with sub-repositories.

These allow downloading targets from another repo and making them available here.
Each repository has a name, which must be unique (including packages in the
current repository).

Rules in subrepos can be accessed in one of two ways:
 - by prefixing them with the name of the repo, for example //my_repo/pkg:target
   to access what would be //pkg:target within it.
 - by using Bazel-style @my_repo//pkg:target syntax.

These are still fairly experimental.
