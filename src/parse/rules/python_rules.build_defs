""" Rules to build Python code.

The output artifacts for Python rules are .pex files (see https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex).
Pex is a rather nice system for combining Python code and all needed dependencies
(excluding the actual interpreter and possibly some system level bits) into a single file.

The process of compiling pex files can be a little slow when including many large files, as
often happens when one's binary includes large compiled dependencies (eg. numpy...). Hence
we have a fairly elaborate optimisation whereby each python_library rule builds a little
zipfile containing just its sources, and all of those are combined at the end to produce
the final .pex. This builds at roughly the same pace for a clean build of a single target,
but is drastically faster for building many targets with similar dependencies or rebuilding
a target which has only had small changes.

    Note that each python_library performs some pre-zipping of its inputs before they're combined
    in a python_binary or python_test. Hence while it's of course not required that all dependencies
    of those rules are python_library rules, it's often a good idea to wrap any large dependencies
    in one to improve incrementality (not necessary for pip_library, of course).
