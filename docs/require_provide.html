<h1 class="title-1">Require / Provide</h1>

<p>
  This is a generalised mechanism for rules to provide specialised dependencies
  to other rules. The most obvious example is
  <code class="code">proto_library</code>, which generates code for multiple
  languages, usually only one of which is actually needed by each dependency
</p>

<p>
  We could break it up into multiple parts explicitly, but ideally we want to
  maintain the illusion that there's one rule by the name given in the BUILD
  file and have all other rules depend only on that. However it's pretty
  suboptimal to have your <code class="code">python_library</code> have to wait
  for the C++ and Java generated code to compile.
</p>

<p>
  This is solved by the <code class="code">proto_library</code> rule declaring
  the following property:
</p>

<pre class="code-container">
  <!-- prettier-ignore -->
  <code data-lang="plz">
    provides = {
        'py': ':python_dependency',
        'java': ':java_dependency',
        'cc': ':cc_dependency',
    }
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  And then the <code class="code">python_library</code> rule is annotated with
</p>

<pre class="code-container">
  <!-- prettier-ignore -->
  <code data-lang="plz">
    requires = ['py'],
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  Individually neither has any effect, but when a rule with a particular
  <code class="code">require</code> depends on another with a matching
  <code class="code">provide</code>, its dependency is matched directly to the
  one specified by the providing rule. This means that it can skip other
  dependencies that it doesn't care about and be matched only to the ones it
  does.
</p>

<p>
  The consequence of this - skipping the actual declared dependency - can be a
  bit nonobvious so should be invoked sparingly. Typically the rule declaring
  <code class="code">provides</code> should be a no-op collecting rule such as
  <code class="code">filegroup</code>
  and the various provided rules shouldn't normally be needed together.
  Different languages are the most common example here (and indeed this feature
  was nearly named
  <code class="code">language</code> at one point).
</p>

<p>
  The <code class="code">requires</code> stanza is also responsible for
  colouring the interactive build output. Currently the available colours are
  hardcoded but one of these days they might become configurable.
