    <h2 class="title-2">Plugins</h2>
    <p>
        The <a class="copy-link" href="/plugins.html">plugin API</a> is a powerful new way to extend Please to support
        new languages and technologies. It offers rule authors greater flexibility in how they configure, distribute,
        and version their rules. In v17, Plugins are becoming the default, replacing all the built-in language rules.
    </p>
    <p>
        The language plugins are hosted in the <a class="copy-link" href="https://github.com/please-build/please-rules">
        please-build</a> github organisation, where we better collaborate with external contributors. If you have a
        plugin you'd like to contribute, please <a class="copy-link" href="https://gitter.im/please-build/Lobby">get
        in touch</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
        To migrate from the built-in rules, simply run <code class="code">plz init plugin [plugin name]</code>.

    <h2 class="title-2">Golang</h2>
    <p>
        The Golang plugin has remained mostly compatible with the builtin rules, however there are a lot of new features
        available!
    </p>
    <h3 class="title-3">Minor changes to import paths</h3>
    <p>
        Previously, the Go rules would let you import a package using two different import paths,
        <code class="code">example.com/owner/repo/package</code>, and
        <code class="code">example.com/owner/repo/package/package</code>. This was a bug that has now been resolved. To
        help migration, use the <code class="code">LegacyImports</code> config option, under
        <code class="code">[Plugin "go"]</code> in your <code class="code">.plzconfig</code> file.
    </p>

    <h3 class="title-3">Improvements to third party modules</h3>
    <p>
        One of the major shortcomings of using Please when compared to the standard go tooling is the toil involved in
        managing third party dependencies. The <code class="code">go_module()</code> rule has served us well, but it has
        some major shortcomings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cyclic dependencies between modules are hard to represent as we compile the entire module in one go.
        It's possible to work around this by downloading the module with one rule and compiling it in parts,
        however this requires a lot of toil, and can get complicated quickly:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-container">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <code data-lang="plz">
    go_mod_download(
        name = "go-opentelemetry_download",
        module = "go.opentelemetry.io/otel",
        version = "v1.11.1",
    )

    go_module(
        name = "go-opentelemetry",
        download = ":go-opentelemetry_download",
        install = [
            ".",
            "baggage",
            "internal",
            "internal/baggage",
            "internal/attribute",
            "internal/global",
            "propagation",
            "semconv/internal",
            "semconv/v1.10.0",
        ],
        module = "go.opentelemetry.io/otel",
        deps = [
            ":go-opentelemetry.trace",
            ":logr",
            ":stdr",
        ],
    )

    # split off due to go-opentelemetry's circular dependency with go-opentelemetry.trace
    go_module(
        name = "go-opentelemetry_1",
        download = ":go-opentelemetry_download",
        install = [
            "attribute",
            "codes",
        ],
        module = "go.opentelemetry.io/otel",
    )
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        Additionally, dependencies between modules must be explicitly defined, along with the packages that we need from
        that module. This results in a slow, iterative cycle of building, and waiting for the next compiler error to
        figure out which package or module we're missing. We also often end up relying on wildcards, compiling more of t
        he module than we actually need because figuring out the set of packages we actually need is so hard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Compiling large modules with a single rule like this can also take a long time. Some modules such and the AWS
        SDK can take upwards for 4 minutes to compile. This happens in a single build task so often can't take advantage
        of multicore systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the Go plugin, we have introduced a brand new build rule called <code class="code">go_repo()</code>, which
        uses a wildly different paradigm:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-container">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <code data-lang="plz">
    go_repo(module="github.com/google/go-cmp", version="v0.5.9")
    go_repo(module="github.com/stretchr/testify", version="v1.8.0")
    go_repo(module="go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace", version="v1.11.1")
    go_repo(module="go.opentelemetry.io/otel", version="v1.11.1")
    go_repo(module="github.com/go-logr/stdr", version="v1.2.2")
    go_repo(module="github.com/pmezard/go-difflib", version="v1.0.0")
    go_repo(module="github.com/stretchr/objx", version="v0.4.0")
    go_repo(module="gopkg.in/yaml.v3", version="v3.0.1")
    go_repo(module="gopkg.in/check.v1", version="v0.0.0-20161208181325-20d25e280405")
    go_repo(module="github.com/go-logr/logr", version="v1.2.3")
    go_repo(module="github.com/davecgh/go-spew", version="v1.1.1")
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        By treating third party modules as subrepos, we can generate individual build
        targets for each package! This eliminates all these problems with the existing
        <code class="code">go_module()</code> rules:
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li>
            <span>
                The modules depend on each other using a naming convention, meaning that users don't have to define
                dependencies between modules. In fact, the only mandatory arguments for
                <code class="code">go_repo()</code> are the module name and version.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Targets can depend on individual packages within the go repo, which means that we get far better
                granularity. We actually use the same build rules (<code class="code">go_library()</code> and
                <code class="code">go_binary()</code>) to compile the packages in the subrepo!
            </span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Labels follow the following format:
        <code class="code">///third_party/go/github.com_module_name//package/name</code>.
        To depend on <code class="code">github.com/stretchr/testify/assert</code>, use
        <code class="code">///third_party/go/github.com_stretchr_testify//assert</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        As these build labels are quite cumbersome, you may pass a name and install list to
        <code class="code">go_repo()</code>:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-container">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <code data-lang="plz">
    go_repo(
        name = "testify",
        install = ["assert", "require"],
        module = "github.com/stretchr/testify",
        version = "v1.8.0",
    )
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        You may then use <code class="code">//third_party/go:testify</code> as an alias for
        <code class="code">///third_party/go/github.com_stretchr_testify//assert</code> and
        <code class="code">///third_party/go/github.com_stretchr_testify//require</code>.
    </p>
    <h3 class="title-3">Improvements to the toolchain and standard library</h3>
    <p>
        In go v1.20, they stopped distributing the SDK in binary form with the SDK. The Go rules depend on these
        binaries. The simplest way to work with go v1.20 is to use the <code class="code">go_toolchain()</code> rule,
        which now compiles the SDK for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under the hood, the <code class="code">go_toolchain()</code> rule is using
        <code class="code">go_stdlib()</code>, which compiles the standard library as a normal build target. This detail
        lets us support additional features such as cross compilation, build modes, and race detection by allowing
        Please to re-build the standard library as needed. For example,
        <code class="code">plz build -o plugin.go.race:true //src:main</code>, will build that target with race
        detection enabled. There's also <code class="code">go.buildmode</code> for different build modes. Both of these
        can also be configured in <code class="code">[Plugin "go"]</code> in your <code class="code">.plzconfig</code>.
    </p>
    <h3 class="title-3">Go package driver</h3>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/please-build/go-rules/blob/master/tools/driver/README.md" class="copy-link">Go
        packages driver</a> is an experimental tool that provides a bridge between go tooling and build systems like
        Please. Tools like gopls, gosec, and many of the linters included in golangci-lint will use this.

    <h2 class="title-2">Proto</h2>
    <p>
        In v17 we have implemented a new approach to the proto rules. The original proto rules supported a fixed set of
        languages, and extending them with new plugins proved quite difficult. The new proto rules provide an sdk for
        adding new protoc plugins for new languages and targets e.g. gRPC gateways.
    </p>
    <p>
        So far, <a class="copy-link" href="https://github.com/please-build/go-proto-rules">Golang</a> and
        <a class="copy-link" href="https://github.com/please-build/python-proto-rules">Python</a> are supported, however
        there are plans to support C++ and Java in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new proto rules don't currently support the same set of languages. For a drop in replacement, you may use
        <code class="code">///proto//build_defs:legacy</code>. These rules use the original configuration under
        <code class="code">[Proto]</code>, so there's no need to update your build file.
    </p>

    <h2 class="title-2">Persistent workers</h2>
    <p>
        Due to poor adoption, persistent workers have been removed as of v17. Users migrating to the Java plugin should
        configure <code class="code">JavacTool</code> instead of <code class="code">JavacWorker</code>.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
    <h2 class="title-2">Changes to glob()</h2>
    <p>
        The <code class="code">plz generate</code> subcommand can be used to link generated sources into the source tree
        which can help with integrating with tooling and IDEs, however if you're using glob in that directory, this may
        cause build failures. In v17, glob will omit symlinks by default. If you want to include symlinks, pass
        <code class="code">glob(include_symlinks = True, ...)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Glob is often used to find files on disk to reduce toil in keeping build rules up to date, however it's often
        easy to get the glob pattern wrong. In this case, it used to silently return an empty list which can lead to
        confusing errors. In v17, glob will now throw an exception. If you want to allow glob to match empty files,
        pass <code class="code">glob(allow_empty = True, ...)</code>.
    </p>
