<h1 class="title-1">Extra rules (aka. Pleasings)</h1>

<p>
  Please comes with built-in rules for Go, Python, Java, C++, Protocol Buffers
  and a few other bits &amp; pieces. While it's nice to have a bunch of
  capabilities by default, it's obviously not practical for every language to be
  part of the core repo, and indeed part of the original design was to make it
  easy to add support for new languages without having to update the core code.
</p>

<p>
  We collect support for additional languages in
  <a
    class="copy-link"
    href="https://github.com/thought-machine/pleasings"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >a separate repo</a
  >. These are somewhat pithily named Pleasings and have rules for various new
  languages that are either still pretty early stage and unstable (the rules,
  not the language :) ) or sufficiently esoteric that having them part of the
  core seems inappropriate.
</p>

    Loading additional rules
  </h2>

  <p>
    The simplest and most lightweight way to load new rules is to do it directly
    with <code class="code">subinclude</code>, like so:
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    subinclude('@pleasings//rust')

    rust_library(
        name = 'my_rust_lib',
        srcs = ['mine.rs'],
    )
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    Some rules may have extra requirements, for example some single package in
    which you have to set up a one-off set of targets. The individual rules will
    document what's required.
  </p>

  <h2 class="title-2">
    The more repeatable solution
  </h2>

  <p>
    As noted the above solution is nice and lightweight, and Please will take
    care of deduplicating &amp; caching the download from github, so it works
    fairly well for straightforward cases. But there are times when you might
    want more control, like pinning to a particular version so you're not broken
    by any incompatible changes, or hash verifying the downloaded rules so you
    know you're always getting what you expect.
  </p>

  <p>
    The idiomatic way of achieving this is to set up one centralised package to
    do the download more carefully and subinclude from there. Conventionally we
    use <code class="code">//build_defs</code> but of course this package can be
    anywhere. You'd set up <code class="code">//build_defs/BUILD</code> as
    follows:
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    package(default_visibility = ['PUBLIC'])

    remote_file(
        name = 'rust',
        url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thought-machine/pleasings/4a8158a65ef39e7dd9a1569fbfa1e5eec398e066/rust/rust.build_defs',
        hashes = [
            'bbfa10e522cfc870bfcbfbae6b899b770b54031a',
        ],
    )
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>Then from any other package in your repo you could write the following:</p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    subinclude('//build_defs:rust')

    rust_library(
        name = 'my_rust_lib',
        srcs = ['mine.rs'],
    )
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    This has the advantage of a shorter call to
    <code class="code">subinclude</code> in each package, but more seriously
    states the expected revision &amp; hash in a centralised location so your
    build always uses the same upstream version of the rules to compile it.
