<h1>Third-party dependencies</h1>

<p>Sooner or later, most projects end up needing a dependency on some
  third-party libraries, and one of the jobs of the build system is to
  manage those as well. Please is no exception to this, but it bears a
  little discussion since most systems handle this differently.</p>

<p>In Please, third-party dependencies can be created in any BUILD file
  and manipulated as any other build rule. We encourage methods of fetching
  them that are repeatable; typically each language has one that matches
  up to a common package manager, for example:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="lexicon.html#go_get">go_get</a></li>
    <li><a href="lexicon.html#pip_library">pip_library</a></li>
    <li><a href="lexicon.html#maven_jar">maven_jar</a></li>
  </ul>
  Each of these require explicit declarations of all their dependencies in the
  BUILD file; this is how we pin dependencies & guarantee reproducibility.<br/>
  There are one or two alternatives that show slightly different approaches
  (e.g. <a href="lexicon.html#python_wheel">python_wheel</a> which is more standalone, and
  <a href="lexicon.html#remote_file">remote_file</a> which is a general tool to
  download anything (although often more work is required to actually build it)</p>

<p>The typical idiom we use is to place BUILD files under a third_party directory,
  to make it clear where they're coming from. Commonly we separate them by language
  for multi-language repos as well.<br/>
  See <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/tree/master/third_party/go">third_party/go</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/tree/master/third_party/python">third_party/python</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/tree/master/third_party/java">third_party/java</a>
  in Please's repo for some examples of what these look like.</p>

<p>There's no explicit command to download third-party dependencies (e.g. <code>plz fetch</code> or similar).
  Dependencies are built as part of the build process along with everything else, so
  their downloads can be parallelised with compiling other targets.</p>


<h2><a name="subrepos">Subrepos</a></h2>

<p>Please also supports a concept called "subrepos" which allows fetching arbitrary dependencies
  and attaching build rules to them. These can be depended on from other build rules and generally
  used as normal.</p>

<p>Subrepos are defined using builtins like <a href="lexicon.html#http_archive">http_archive</a> or
  <a href="lexicon.html#github_repo">github_repo</a>. These download a remote file and
  extract it, and make the contents available to other rules. In most cases you can choose to attach a
  BUILD file to them, but it can also use an existing one if appropriate.</p>

<p>For example (as seen <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/blob/master/third_party/cc/BUILD">in the Please repo</a>):
  <pre><code class="language-plz">
    github_repo(
        name = "gtest",
        bazel_compat = True,
        repo = "google/googletest",
        revision = "release-1.8.1",
    )
  </code></pre></p>

<p>Rules within subrepos can be referenced using a triple-slash prefix on rules, anywhere
  where a build rule would normally be accepted. For example:
  <pre><code class="language-plz">
    cc_test(
        name = "my_test",
        ...
        deps = [
            "///third_party/cc/gtest//:gtest_main",
        ],
    )
  </code></pre>

<p>Note that the subrepo label (<code>third_party/cc/gtest</code>) includes the package we defined
  it in earlier. In many ways subrepos mirror the feature in Bazel, but in this case are more
  flexible since they're not limited to being defined at the repo root. For compatibility,
  we also accept an <code>@</code> prefix for subrepos instead of <code>///</code>.</p>

<h2>Comparison to other systems</h2>

<p>For users familiar with Bazel, we expect that writing BUILD files won't be
  challenging, the main difference being that there is no direct equivalent to
  Bazel's WORKSPACE file. As mentioned above, third-party dependencies can occur
  wherever you choose to put them in normal BUILD files.</p>

<p>If you've used Buck before, the model is pretty similar to fetching Maven jars
  using the bucklet for it. This is not entirely coincidental since we were previously
  using Buck so initially Please had to mimic the same interface - but we also
  quite liked it and decided to keep on in the same way.</p>

<p>If you're coming from Gradle or Maven, it's a little more alien due to being less language-specific
  and requiring full transitive dependencies to be specified.<br/>
  There is an <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/pleasings/blob/master/java/maven_jars.build_defs">add-on rule</a>
  which is the closest equivalent; it works by communicating with Maven repositories to
  find dependencies and generating more BUILD rules for them. This can be a little
  unreliable though, since the Maven package format is complex, and your dependencies
  aren't fully within your control and can change between builds - we recommend
  <a href="lexicon.html#maven_jar">maven_jar</a> instead, but understand it's more work to set up.</p>

<p><code>requirements.txt</code> files from Python are not usually especially difficult to
  translate using <a href="lexicon.html#pip_library">pip_library</a>; again we require listing
  transitive dependencies explicitly, but this is not normally too onerous for Python.<br/>
  Since Please needs to know precisely what will be output, the rules can sometimes need a little
  tweaking when the output names don't correspond to the package names (or often a package outputs
  a single .py file instead of a directory).</p>

<p><a href="lexicon.html#go_get">go_get</a> works pretty similarly to the usual <code>go get</code>
  tool, but again only outputs a single package at a time. Writing up the dependencies can be
  eased by using something like <code>go list -f '{{.Deps}}' &lt;package&gt;</code> to discover
  all the dependencies for the package in question.</p>
