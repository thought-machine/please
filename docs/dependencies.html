<h1 class="title-1">Third-party dependencies</h1>

<p>
  Sooner or later, most projects end up needing a dependency on some third-party
  libraries, and one of the jobs of the build system is to manage those as well.
  Please is no exception to this, but it bears a little discussion since most
  systems handle this differently.
</p>

<p>
  In Please, third-party dependencies can be created in any BUILD file and
  manipulated as any other build rule. We encourage methods of fetching them
  that are repeatable; typically each language has one that matches up to a
  common package manager, for example:

        Unfortunately the C/C++ ecosystem lacks a defacto standard third-party
        repository. Thankfully, the Please build language is powerful and can
        reliably build nearly any part of your project. See the
        <a class="copy-link" href="/build_rules.html">writing build rules</a>
        documentation for more information on this.

    </div>

<p>
  Each of these require explicit declarations of all their dependencies in the
  BUILD file; this is how we pin dependencies &amp; guarantee
  reproducibility.<br />
  There are one or two alternatives that show slightly different approaches
  (e.g.
  <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#python_wheel">python_wheel</a>
  which is more standalone, and
  <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#remote_file">remote_file</a>
  which is a general tool to download anything (although often more work is
  required to actually build it)
</p>

<p>
  The typical idiom we use is to place BUILD files under a third_party
  directory, to make it clear where they're coming from. Commonly we separate
  them by language for multi-language repos as well.<br />
  See
  <a
    class="copy-link"

    rel="noopener"

  >
  in Please's repo for some examples of what these look like.
</p>

<p>
  There's no explicit command to download third-party dependencies (e.g.
  <code class="code">plz fetch</code> or similar). Dependencies are built as
  part of the build process along with everything else, so their downloads can
  be parallelised with compiling other targets.
</p>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2" id="subrepos">
    Subrepos
  </h2>

  <p>
    Please also supports a concept called "subrepos" which allows fetching
    arbitrary dependencies and attaching build rules to them. These can be
    depended on from other build rules and generally used as normal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Subrepos are defined using builtins like
    <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#http_archive">http_archive</a>
    or
    <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#github_repo">github_repo</a>. These
    download a remote file and extract it, and make the contents available to
    other rules. In most cases you can choose to attach a BUILD file to them,
    but it can also use an existing one if appropriate.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example (as seen
    <a
      class="copy-link"
      href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/blob/master/third_party/cc/BUILD"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      >in the Please repo</a
    >):
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    github_repo(
        name = "gtest",
        bazel_compat = True,
        repo = "google/googletest",
        revision = "release-1.8.1",
    )
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    Rules within subrepos can be referenced using a triple-slash prefix on
    rules, anywhere where a build rule would normally be accepted. For example:
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    cc_test(
        name = "my_test",
        ...
        deps = [
            "///third_party/cc/gtest//:gtest_main",
        ],
    )
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    Note that the subrepo label (<code class="code">third_party/cc/gtest</code>)
    includes the package we defined it in earlier. In many ways subrepos mirror
    the feature in Bazel, but in this case are more flexible since they're not
    limited to being defined at the repo root. For compatibility, we also accept
    an <code class="code">@</code> prefix for subrepos instead of
    <code class="code">///</code>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">
    Comparison to other systems
  </h2>

  <p>
    For users familiar with Bazel, we expect that writing BUILD files won't be
    challenging, the main difference being that there is no direct equivalent to
    Bazel's WORKSPACE file. As mentioned above, third-party dependencies can
    occur wherever you choose to put them in normal BUILD files.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you've used Buck before, the model is pretty similar to fetching Maven
    jars using the bucklet for it. This is not entirely coincidental since we
    were previously using Buck so initially Please had to mimic the same
    interface - but we also quite liked it and decided to keep on in the same
    way.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're coming from Gradle or Maven, it's a little more alien due to being
    less language-specific and requiring full transitive dependencies to be
    specified.<br />
    There is an
    <a
      class="copy-link"
      href="https://github.com/thought-machine/pleasings/blob/master/java/maven_jars.build_defs"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      >add-on rule</a
    >
    which is the closest equivalent; it works by communicating with Maven
    repositories to find dependencies and generating more BUILD rules for them.
    This can be a little unreliable though, since the Maven package format is
    complex, and your dependencies aren't fully within your control and can
    change between builds - we recommend
    <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#maven_jar">maven_jar</a>
    instead, but understand it's more work to set up.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code class="code">requirements.txt</code> files from Python are not usually
    especially difficult to translate using
    <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#pip_library">pip_library</a>; again
    we require listing transitive dependencies explicitly, but this is not
    normally too onerous for Python.<br />
    Since Please needs to know precisely what will be output, the rules can
    sometimes need a little tweaking when the output names don't correspond to
    the package names (or often a package outputs a single .py file instead of a
    directory).
  </p>

  <p>
    <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#go_get">go_get</a> works pretty
    similarly to the usual <code class="code">go get</code> tool, but again only
    outputs a single package at a time. Writing up the dependencies can be eased
    by using something like
    <code class="code">go list -f '{{.Deps}}' &lt;package&gt;</code> to discover
    all the dependencies for the package in question.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">Verification</h2>

  <p>
    An important concept of Please is strict validation of inputs and outputs of
    each build. Third-party dependencies are an important case for this since
    they allow code you don't totally control into your build.<br />
    Please has two explicit mechanisms for controlling this.
  </p>

  <section class="mt4">
    <h3 class="title-3">Hash verification</h3>

    <p>
      Please can natively verify hashes of packages. Some of the built-in rules
      for fetching things from third-party repos have this option, and you can
      add it to your own genrules. For example, one of the Python libraries we
      use:
    </p>

    <pre class="code-container">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <code data-lang="plz">
    pip_library(
        name = 'six',
        version = '1.9.0',
        outs = ['six.py'],
        hashes = ['sha256: 0c31ab7cf1a2761efa32d9a7e891ddeadc0d8673'],
    )
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      This declares that the calculated sha256 hash of the package must match
      one of the given set, and it's a failure if not.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can find the output hash of a particular target by running
      <code class="code">plz hash //third_party/python:six</code> which will
      calculate it for you, and you can enter it in the BUILD file.<br />
      If it changes (for example when you update the version) plz can update the
      BUILD file for you via
      <code class="code">plz hash --update //third_party/python:six</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason for allowing multiple hashes is for rules that generate
      different outputs on different architectures; this is common for Python
      libraries which have a compiled component, for example.
    </p>

    <p>
      For testing purposes you can run Please with the
      <code class="code">--nohash_verification</code> flag which will reduce
      hash verification failures to a warning message only.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that when using this you must be careful that the outputs of your
      rule are really deterministic. This is generally true for
      <code class="code">remote_file</code> calls, but obviously only if the
      server returns the same thing every time for that URL. Some care should be
      taken with <code class="code">pip_library</code> since the outputs of a
      <code class="code">pip install</code> for a package containing binary (not
      pure Python) modules are not bit-for-bit identical if compiled locally,
      only if you downloaded a precompiled wheel. Different Python and OS
      versions can affect it too.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code class="code">sha256:</code> prefix is informative only and
      indeed any string can occur before the colon. In future we may extend this
      to allow specifying other hash types.
    </p>

    <h3 class="title-3">
      Licence validation
    </h3>

    <p>
      Please can attempt to autodetect licences from some third-party packages
      and inform you if they're not ones you'd accept. You mark licences in the
      .plzconfig file like so:
    </p>

    <pre class="code-container">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <code>
    [licences]
    accept = MIT
    accept = BSD
    reject = MS-EULA
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      By default, with no <code class="code">[licences]</code> section, Please
      won't perform any licence checking.<br />
      Once you've added some any package with a licence must have a matching
      accepted licence in the config.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently we can autodetect licences from
      <code class="code">pip_library</code> and
      <code class="code">maven_jars</code> rules, you can also set them manually
      via the <code class="code">licences</code> attribute on a rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      It bears mentioning that this is done as a best-effort - since licences
      and their locations are not standardised in pip (and many other places) we
      can't always be fully confident about how to match licence names and hence
      don't try (for example, <code class="code">Apache 2</code>,
      <code class="code">Apache-2.0</code>, and
      <code class="code">The Apache Software License, version 2</code> all refer
      to the same licence, despite being very different strings, whereas
      <code class="code">LGPL</code> and <code class="code">AGPL</code> are
      significantly different licences but only one letter apart).
    </p>

    <p>
      Please also isn't a lawyer and can't provide advice about whether a
      specific licence is suitable for you or not. Only you can make that
      decision.
    </p>
