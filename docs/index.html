      languages and can automate nearly any aspect of your build process.

          <h2><span class="violet">Speed up your builds.</span></h2>
          <p>Please is designed to parallelise builds & tests to make the most of your CPU.
	        It's written in Go so it's fast & efficient itself, and it can build just the required
            parts of your code on each invocation.</p>

          <h2><span class="green">Help your deployment.</span></h2>
          <p>All your code & dependencies get packed into a single file which can easily be
	        deployed & run on a server. This helps deploy languages like Python which don't
            do this naturally.</p>

          <h2><span class="yellow">Unify your build process.</span></h2>
          <p>Because Please can build many languages already (and you can easily write rules
	        to teach it about others) you always invoke one tool to build any language or run
            any test, simplifying your continuous integration and development processes.</p>

          <h2><span class="red">Continuous integration & pre-merge testing.</span></h2>
          <p>We've developed Please in tandem with our internal integration	tools, so whenever
            any of our engineers merges a pull request, we invoke it to make sure any affected
            tests are passing before merging it in. Because Please allows fine-grained dependencies
            and knows them for every test, we can run just the affected ones to keep this step
            fast & lightweight.</p>

          <h2><span class="turquoise">Isolate your tests.</span></h2>
          <p>Got integration tests that need to spin up servers, write files, and find ports?
	        No problem, tests can be easily sandboxed to isolate them from the network
            and each other.</p>
