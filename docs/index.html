        Tests behave better in a sandbox

        Build steps are executed in their own tightly controlled hermetic

        explicitly been given access to, builds have never been more correct!
        Please can take this a step further, utilising

      <p class="white">
        Built from the ground up with correct and reliable model for incremental
        builds, Please only builds what it needs to. Combined with the tightly
        controlled build environment, task parallelism, and distributed caching,
        this makes for a reliable and performant build system at scale. You worry
        about what to build, Please will worry about when, or indeed, if to build
        it!

        Please can even manage your toolchain; no more talking to IT to update to
        the next language version. Define aliases for common tasks leveraging
        Please auto-completions for the ultimate developer experience. Written in
        Go, Please provides all this power behind a snappy user experience with no
        runtime dependency.

        With a powerful framework for automating every part of your build process,

        crafting a truly holistic build process. Generate code, configurations,
        deployment manifests, or whatever your imagination conceives, while rest
        assured Please is handling correctness and performance no matter what you
        do.

        Less incantation, more transparency
      </h2>
      <p class="white">
        Please isn't magic; it's built on a set of powerful core mechanisms that
        can be easily understood. By relying on these mechanisms rather than
        opaque abstractions, configuration is light weight, largely optional, and
        easily understood. There's no central workspace file that nobody truly
        owns with pages of configuration and incantation nobody truly understands.

        Designed with continuous integration in mind

      <p class="white">
        We've developed Please in tandem with our internal integration tools, so
        integrating with Please is a dream. Leveraging the build graph and git
        integrations, determine the minimal set of targets that have been affected
        between changes. Run the affected tests, then export artifacts with a
        single command. Leave it to Please to figure out what needs to be built
        and re-deploy only that which has changed!
