            <h2><span class="red">Tests behave better in a sandbox</span></h2>
            <p>Build steps are executed in their own tightly controlled hermetic environment. With only access to files
                and env variables that they have explicitly been given access to, builds have never been more correct!
                Please can optionally take this a step further, utilising
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces">Linux name-spacing</a> to sandbox the network
                and filesystem! No more "works on my machine!"</p>

            <h2><span class="violet">And run faster with robust caching</span></h2>
            <p>Please is built from the ground up with correct and reliable model for incremental builds, which
                can be relied on across languages and technologies. Combined with the tightly controlled build
                environment, task parallelism, and distributed caching, this makes for a reliable and performant build
                system at scale. You worry about what to build, Please will worry about when to build it, no matter what
                languages or technologies your teams choose!</p>

            <h2><span class="green">The developer experience you deserve</span></h2>
            <p>Stop wasting time learning with tooling; Please provides a uniform and seamless interface across your
                repo. Build any target, and execute any test, all with the same CLI! Please can download itself and
                your toolchain from a wrapper script: no more puppet or ansible, no more talking to IT to get the next
                language version. Define aliases for common tasks leveraging Please auto-completions for the ultimate
                developer experience. Written in Go, Please provides all this power behind a snappy user experience with
                no runtime dependency.

            <h2><span class="yellow">Across any technology you choose</span></h2>
            <p>There's more to a build system than just compiling code! Please provides a powerful framework for
                automating every part of your build process. The built-in definitions can help you quickly get started,
                then expand on them, crafting a truly holistic build process. Generate code, configurations, deployment
                manifests, or whatever your imagination conceives, while rest assured Please is ensuring correctness
                and performance no matter what you do.</p>

            <h2><span class="turquoise">Less incantation, more transparency</span></h2>
            <p>Please isn't magic; it's built on a set of powerful core mechanisms that can be easily understood.
                By relying on these mechanisms rather than opaque abstractions, configuration is light weight,
                largely optional, and easily understood. There's no central workspace file that nobody truly owns with
                pages of configuration and incantation nobody truly understands.</p>

            <h2><span class="pink">Designed with continuous integration in mind</span></h2>
            <p>We've developed Please in tandem with our internal integration tools, so integrating with Please is a
                dream. Leveraging the build graph and git integrations, determine the minimal set of targets that have
                been effected between changes. Run the effected tests, then export artifacts with a single command.
                Leave it to Please to figure out what needs to be built and re-deploy only that which has changed!
