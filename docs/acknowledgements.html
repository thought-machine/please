<p>Thanks also to the rest of our colleagues at Thought Machine who've put up with
the process of building this and being <s>un</s> willing <s>guinea pigs</s> beta testers for it.</p>

<p>And thanks to our colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/fortnumfox">Fox</a> who did the
design for this website in a rare moment out from under our CEO's watchful eye.</p>

<p>The inspiration for much of the core design was of course taken from Google's Blaze,
we're appreciative to them for that, even though we still wanted to try our own take on it :)</p>

<p>Finally, thanks to our fearless leader Paul who continually insists that we should
&quot;get on with our work&quot; and &quot;stop messing around with the build system&quot;.
But he's not actually fired us for spending time on this which he has our thanks for.</p>
