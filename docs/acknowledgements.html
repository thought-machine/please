  Thanks also to the rest of our colleagues at Thought Machine who've put up
  with the process of building this and being <s>un</s> willing
  <s>guinea pigs</s> beta testers for it.
</p>

<p>
  And thanks to our colleague

  who did the design for this website in a rare moment out from under our CEO's
  watchful eye.
</p>

<p>
  The inspiration for much of the core design was of course taken from Google's
  Blaze, we're appreciative to them for that, even though we still wanted to try
  our own take on it :)
</p>

<p>
  Finally, thanks to our fearless leader Paul who continually insists that we
  should &quot;get on with our work&quot; and &quot;stop messing around with the
  build system&quot;. But he's not actually fired us for spending time on this
  which he has our thanks for.
</p>
