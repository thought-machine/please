    <h1>Please quickstart</h1>

    <h2>System requirements</h2>
    <p>Please supports Linux and OSX at the moment. We're internally using Ubuntu Trusty and Yosemite but it should
      work on other reasonably recent distros.</p>

    <h2>Installing</h2>
    <p><code>curl https://get.please.build | bash</code></p>
    <p>This will download and install the latest version of Please on your system.</p>

    <p>It needs a Python parser to run; it ships with support for CPython (only version 2 for now)
      and PyPy. On Linux it should automatically attempt to fetch a portable version of PyPy if not
      available; on OSX you'll need to install it using <code>brew install pypy</code> or similar.<br/>
      In either case, if you want to use CPython, you'll need cffi installed;
      <code>pip install cffi>=1.5.0</code> should take care of it.</p>

    <h2>Shell completion</h2>
    <p>Please comes with completion scripts for Bash and zsh built-in.<p>

    <p>You can produce them by running <code>plz query completions --bash_script</code> or
      <code>plz query completions --zsh_script</code>. This is handy to add to your .bashrc, for example:<br/>
      <pre><code>source <(plz query completions --bash_script)</code></pre></p>

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>Run <code>plz init</code> at the root of your repo to create the .plzconfig file.
      There are many options that can be configured in this file but you can worry about them
      later - the defaults should be fine to begin with.</p>

    <p>You will need to write some BUILD files to define how to compile your code.
      Carry on to <a href="basics.html">Please Basics</a> which will explain more about it.
    </p>
