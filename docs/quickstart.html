    <h1>Please quickstart</h1>

    <h2>System requirements</h2>
    <p>Please supports Linux, macOS and FreeBSD at the moment. It should work on reasonably
      recent releases of each without additional requirements.</p>

    <h2>Installing</h2>
    <p><code>curl https://get.please.build | bash</code></p>
    <p>This will download and install the latest version of Please on your system.<br/>
      It also adds itself to your <code>PATH</code>; you may need to <code>source ~/.bashrc</code>
      or <code>source ~/.zshrc</code> after install to get that updated.</p>

    <p>If you're using <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>, you can install using that:
      <pre><code>brew tap thought-machine/please
brew install please</code></pre></p>

    <p>Finally, if you'd prefer more manual installation, grab a tarball off
      <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/releases">our releases page</a> and extract
      it yourself; it normally lives in <code>~/.please</code> but you can put it where you want.</p>

    <h2>Shell completion</h2>
    <p>Please comes with a completion script for Bash and zsh built-in.</p>

    <p>You can produce it by running <code>plz --completion_script</code>.
      This is handy to add to your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code>, for example:<br/>
      <pre><code>source <(plz --completion_script)</code></pre></p>

    <p>The script will complete subcommands and flags but most relevantly can also complete
      build labels by reading BUILD files for you.</p>

    <h2>BUILD file Language Protocol Server</h2>
    <p>Please ships with a language server for build files. It follows the
        <a href="https://langserver.org/">language server protocol</a> from VS Code.</p>

    <p>To use LPS, simply download the language server protocol plugin for your favourite editor,
    and run the binary with the command <code>plz tool lps</code>.</p>

    <p>Currently LPS supports auto-completion (this works with build labels too!), hover, goto definition,
    diagnostics, signature help, auto-formatting and references.</p>

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>Run <code>plz init</code> at the root of your repo to create the .plzconfig file.
      There are many options that can be configured in this file but you can worry about them
      later - the defaults should be fine to begin with.</p>

    <p>You will need to write some BUILD files to define how to compile your code.
      Carry on to <a href="basics.html">Please Basics</a> which will explain more about it.
