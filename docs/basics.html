<h1 class="title-1">Please basics</h1>

<p>
  If you're familiar with Blaze / Bazel, Buck or Pants you will probably find
  Please very familiar. Otherwise, don't worry, it's not very complicated...

  <h2 class="title-2">BUILD files</h2>

  <p>
    Please targets are defined in files named BUILD. These are analogous to
    Makefiles in that they define buildable targets for that directory.
    Fortunately, they do so in a rather nicer syntax.<br />
    We refer to a directory containing a BUILD file as a <em>package</em>.

    For more information on the format of BUILD files, read the

    here.

  <h2 class="title-2">Build targets</h2>

  <p>
    Each BUILD file can contain a number of <em>build targets</em>. These are
    units of buildable code which can be reused by other build targets. An
    example is probably worth 1000 words at this point:

  <p>
    This snippet defines three build targets; a build target is simply a thing
    that can be built by Please and typically appears as a single object in the
    build file (as the
    <code class="code">python_library</code>,
    <code class="code">python_binary</code> and
    <code class="code">python_test</code> are above).
  </p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">my_library</code> is simply a collection of
        <code class="code">file1.py</code> and
        <code class="code">file2.py</code>.<br />
        For some languages these might be compiled, for Python of course they're
        simply made available for other rules.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">my_binary</code> creates a deployable Python binary
        with an entry point in <code class="code">my_main.py</code>.<br />
        It also defines a <em>dependency</em> on
        <code class="code">my_library</code> since it will use it
        internally.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">my_library_test</code> defines a test on
        <code class="code">my_library</code>. Tests are run by Please and their
        results are aggregated.</span
      >
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This illustrates the core points of Please; every rule clearly defines its
    inputs - its own sources and its dependencies - and since these are known
    Please can be aggressive about parallelising, caching and reusing build
    artifacts.

    Okay, great, so how do I actually use them?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Let's assume the build rules given above are defined in a file in your repo
    named package/BUILD. You can do the following:
  </p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">plz build //package:my_library</code> builds the
        library. This isn't drastically useful on its own, of course...</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">plz build //package:my_binary</code> builds the
        binary and all needed libraries that it depends on. That produces a
        single output file which you could copy to another machine.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">plz run //package:my_binary</code> builds and runs
        the binary immediately.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">plz test //package:my_library_test</code> builds and
        runs the test and shows you the results.</span
      >
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">Build labels</h2>

  <p>
    That brings us to the topic of <em>build labels</em>, which are identifiers
    of build targets. As you've just seen, these are of the form
    <code class="code">//package:target</code>, where
    <code class="code">package</code> is the path from the repo root to that
    package, and <code class="code">target</code> is the name of the target
    within that package.<br />
    This is the most common form to identify targets absolutely, but there is
    also a convenient shorthand where we omit the part before the colon (as you
    saw earlier as well) to refer to a target within the current package.
  </p>

  <p>
    The convention is to use
    <code class="code">lower_case_with_underscores</code> for both package names
    and target names.<br />
    This is not just for looks; in many languages (eg. Python) the file path
    appears within the source files, and so it's important to choose something
    that's a valid lexical identifier.
  </p>

  <p>There are also some special pseudo-labels:</p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">//mypackage:all</code> refers to all targets in
        'mypackage'.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">//mypackage/...</code> refers to all targets in
        'mypackage' and anywhere beneath it in the filesystem.</span
      >
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Build targets can't use these as dependencies; these are primarily for using
    on the command line or in the visibility specification for a target.
    The special pseudo-label <code class="code">PUBLIC</code> is equivalent to
    <code class="code">//...</code> in visibility specifications.
  </p>

    The BUILD file format
  </h2>

  <p>
    You may have noticed that the invocations in BUILD files look a bit like
    function calls. This is not coincidence; it is not just a declarative
    language, it's also a scripting language that allows you to programmatically
    create targets. For example, let's say you want to translate your
    documentation to a bunch of languages:
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    for language in ['en_NZ', 'en_GB', 'it_IT', 'es_MX', 'el_GR']:
        lang_docs = genrule(
            name = 'txt_documentation_' + language,
            srcs = ['docs.txt'],
            outs = [f'docs_{language}.txt'],
            tools = ['//tools:translate_tool'],
            cmd = f'$TOOL -i $SRC --language {language} &gt; "$OUT"',
        )

        genrule(
            name = 'documentation_' + language,
            srcs = [lang_docs],
            outs = [f'docs_{language}.html'],
            tools = ['//tools:html_doc_tool'],
            cmd = '$TOOL --src $SRC --out "$OUT"',
            visibility = ['PUBLIC'],
        )
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    Obviously this would be a bit repetitive if you redefined the rules
    separately for each language. Instead, we can take advantage of the build
    language to genericise them across languages; for each language we translate
    it and then format it as HTML.
  </p>

  <p>
    The language itself shares some similarity to Python so it should feel
    familiar to many people. There is a
    <a class="copy-link" href="/language.html">complete description</a>
    of it available if you're curious about more details.
