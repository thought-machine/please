<h1 class="title-1">Persistent workers</h1>

<p>
  Please's usual model for build targets is that they're built in isolation from
  one another, by executing a command in a known directory that generates the
  expected outputs. In most cases this is great since it helps guarantee
  reproducibility, but sometimes it can be less than ideal - say your command
  has quite a lot of overhead to start up which you'd like to amortise between
  multiple invocations.
</p>

<p>
  A motivating example here was the Java compiler which has a lot more startup
  overhead than natively implemented compilers (e.g.
  <code class="code">gcc</code>, <code class="code">clang</code> or
  <code class="code">go tool compile</code>). Most Java build tools mitigate
  this by starting a single instance of it which is then reused to compile
  multiple packages.
</p>

<p>
  Please supports a similar concept; it can be instructed to start workers as
  inferior processes that it manages the lifetime of. They are specified on a
  rule as follows:
</p>

<pre class="code-container">
  <!-- prettier-ignore -->
  <code data-lang="plz">
    genrule(
        name = "my_rule",
        srcs = ["in.txt"],
        outs = ["out.txt"],
        tools = ["//tools:my_worker"],
        cmd = "$(worker //tools:my_worker) --do_work",
    )
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  The worker itself must be marked as binary and will be built first if needed
  (it can also be a simple command if the tool is available globally).

    Communication
  </h2>

  <p>
    Please communicates with the tool over stdin / stdout as a series of JSON
    messages. The structures in each direction are documented in

      >src/worker/types.go</a
    >; essentially it gets one message per build target with some extra
    metadata, and responds describing whther it was successful or not.<br />
    There's a minimal implementation of a worker in
    <a

      >test/workers/worker.go</a

    the

    repository.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any messages that the process prints to its stderr will be consumed by
    Please and surfaced as errors; this provides a channel for the process to
    warn if things are going seriously wrong for some reason (i.e. more than
    just normal compile failures.

    Tests
  </h2>

  <p>
    A similar mechanism exists for tests to share resources in the nature of
    common fixture setup, but that can be shared between multiple separate test
    targets. They work in very much the same way as when building and the same
    principles above apply.
  </p>

  <p>
    The main conceptual difference is that the test worker is not responsible
    for actually executing the tests; Please still does that, and the worker
    simply does whatever setup is needed and responds back indicating when each
    test should begin.
