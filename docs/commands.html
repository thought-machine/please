    mechanism that is aware of your build graph, all the commands and flags, and
    any <a class="copy-link" href="/config.html#alias">aliases</a> you may have
    configured. To enable Please completions, add this line to your

          </h4>

          <p>
            The build config to use. The effect this has depends on the
            language; typically it allows swapping between a debug or an
            optimised build.<br />
            The default is
            <code class="code">opt</code> to build optimised code;
            <code class="code">dbg</code> is accepted for C++ and Go to build
            code with debugging symbols.<br />
            This has no effect on Python or Java rules.

          <p>
            Sets the location of the repo root to use. Normally plz assumes it
            is within the repo somewhere and locates the root itself, this

  <h2 id="build" class="title-2">
    plz build

  <p>
    This is the most common and obvious command; it builds one or more targets
    and all their dependencies. A plain
    <code class="code">plz build</code> attempts to build everything, but more
    usually you can tell it to build a particular target or targets by passing
    them on the command line afterwards. For example:
  </p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">plz build //src/core:core</code> builds just the one

    <li>
      <span

    <li>
      <span><code class="code">src/core/BUILD</code>.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">plz build //src/...</code> builds every target in
        <code class="code">src</code> and all subdirectories.</span
      >
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 id="test" class="title-2">plz test</h2>

  <p>
    This is also a very commonly used command, it builds one or more targets and
    then runs their tests. Which tests to run are specified by positional
    arguments as described for
    <code class="code">plz build</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    After successful completion a combined test output file will be written to
    <code class="code">plz-out/log/test_results.xml</code>
    in something approximating xUnit XML format.
  </p>

  <p>It takes a few special flags:</p>
  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <div>
        <h3 class="mt1 f6 lh-title">
          <code class="code">--num_runs</code>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Determines how many times to run each test. The default is 1, but can
          be more for tests marked as flaky.
        </p>
      </div>
    </li>

        <p>
          The return value is 0 regardless of whether any tests fail or not. It
          will only be nonzero if they fail to build completely.<br />
          This is not commonly used, it's mostly useful for CI automation which
          will parse the results file to determine ultimate success / failure.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3 class="mt1 f6 lh-title">
          <code class="code">-d, --debug</code>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Turns on interactive debug mode for this test. You can only specify
          one test with this flag, because it attaches an interactive debugger
          to catch failures.<br />
          It only works for some test types, currently python (with pytest as
          the test runner), C and C++.<br />
          It implies
          <code class="code">-c dbg</code> unless that flag is explicitly
          passed.

  <p>
    Very similar to

        <p>
          Includes any transitively dependent source files in the coverage
          report (the default is just files from relevant packages).
        </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <h3 class="mt1 f6 lh-title">
          <code class="code">--include_file</code>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Files to include in the coverage report (the flag can be passed more
          than once for multiple).
        </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <h3 class="mt1 f6 lh-title">
          <code class="code">--coverage_results_file</code>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Similar to
          <code class="code">--test_results_file</code>, determines where to
          write the aggregated coverage results to.
        </p>

    <li>
      <div>
        <h3 class="mt1 f6 lh-title">
          <code class="code">-d, --debug</code>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Turns on interactive debug mode for this test. You can only specify
          one test with this flag, because it attaches an interactive debugger
          to catch failures.<br />
          It only works for some test types, currently python (with pytest as
          the test runner), C and C++.<br />
          It implies
          <code class="code">-c dbg</code> unless that flag is explicitly
          passed.
        </p>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 id="run" class="title-2">plz run</h2>

  <p>
    This is essentially shorthand for calling
    <code class="code">plz build</code> and then running the result of whatever
    target was built. It's often handy for iterating on a single target such
    that one command builds and reruns it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because of the way the target is run after, you have to provide exactly one
    target to this command. The target must be marked as
    <code class="code">binary</code> in its rule definition (this is implicit
    for the various builtin <code class="code">_binary</code> rules such as
    <code class="code">go_binary</code> etc).
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to pass flags to the target rather than plz itself, you must
    pass them last on the command line, after a
    <code class="code">--</code>. This tells Please not to attempt to parse them
    as its own flags.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two optional subcommands
    <code class="code">sequential</code> and
    <code class="code">parallel</code> which allow running multiple targets in
    one go. As the names suggest, they run targets either one after the other or
    all in parallel.<br />
    In either case, the semantics are a little different to running a single
    target; arguments must be passed one by one via the
    <code class="code">-a</code> flag, and while stdout / stderr are connected
    to the current terminal, stdin is not connected (because it'd not be clear
    which process would consume it).
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 id="watch" class="title-2">
    plz watch
  </h2>

  <p>
    Watches a set of targets for changes. Whenever any one of their source files
    (or that of any dependency) is changed, the targets will be rebuilt. If any
    of them are tests, then they will be run as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Optionally you can pass the
    <code class="code">--run</code> flag if you'd like the targets to be run
    (using <code class="code">plz run</code>) instead of just built / tested.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 id="query" class="title-2">
    plz query
  </h2>

  <p>
    This allows you to introspect various aspects of the build graph. There are
    a number of subcommands identifying what you want to query for:
  </p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">alltargets</code>: Lists all targets in the
        graph.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span><code class="code">filter</code>: Filter targets based on <code class="code">--include</code> and <code class="code">--exclude</code>.
        This is commonly used with other commands. For example, to run e2e tests separately from other tests:
        <code class="code">plz query changes --since master > plz-out/changes</code>, then
        <code class="code">cat plz-out/changes | plz query filter --include e2e - | plz test -</code>.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">changes</code>: Queries changed targets versus a
        revision or from a set of files.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">completions</code>: Prints possible completions for
        a string.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">deps</code>: Queries the dependencies of a
        target.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">graph</code>: Prints a JSON representation of the
        build graph.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">input</code>: Prints all transitive inputs of a
        target.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">output</code>: Prints all outputs of a target.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">print</code>: Prints a representation of a single
        target.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">reverseDeps</code>: Queries all the reverse
        dependencies of a target.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">somepath</code>: Queries for a path between two
        targets.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        ><code class="code">rules</code>: Prints out a machine-parseable
        description of all currently known build rules.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">whatinputs</code>: Prints out target(s) with provided file(s) as inputs
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">whatoutputs</code>: Prints out target(s) responsible for outputting provided file(s)
      </span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Note that this is not the same as the query language accepted by Bazel and
    Buck, if you're familiar with those; generally this is lighter weight but
    less flexible and powerful. We haven't ruled out adding that in the future
    but have no concrete plans to do so at present.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 id="clean" class="title-2">
    plz clean
  </h2>

  <p>Cleans up output build artifacts and caches.</p>

  <p>
    This is not normally necessary since generally incrementality detection will
    ensure that targets are rebuilt if needed. It's possible though for
    particularly determined rules to do something they shouldn't in which case
    this might be needed, or (inconceivable though it is) a bug might exist that
    led to incorrect artifacts being cached.
  </p>

  <p>
    If given no arguments this cleans the entire plz-out directory and the
    directory cache, if configured. It returns immediately with the actual
    removal proceeding in the background; you can invoke other plz commands
    freely while that continues.<br />
    You can pass the
    <code class="code">--nobackground</code> flag if you'd prefer to wait
    though.
  </p>

  <p>
    If it's given targets to clean, it will need to perform a parse to work out
    what to clean, and will not return until those targets have been cleaned.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code class="code">--nocache</code> flag works like all other commands
    here, but bears mentioning since it will prevent artifacts from being
    removed from the cache (by default they're cleaned from there too).
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 id="hash" class="title-2">plz hash</h2>

  <p>
    This command calculates the hash of outputs for one or more targets. These
    can then be passed in the
    <code class="code">hash</code> or
    <code class="code">hashes</code> attributes of those targets to verify their
    output is as expected - this is useful for fetching third-party dependencies
    to ensure they are not changing between builds.
  </p>

  <p>
    The relevant targets will be built in order to calculate the hash, but if
    they fail because it doesn't match the one recorded in the BUILD file plz
    will still exit successfully (although the output files will still not be
    created).
  </p>

  <p>
    One can of course achieve the same effect via running
    <code class="code">plz build</code> and reading the actual hash when it
    fails, but this way is generally considered nicer.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code class="code">--update</code> flag will cause Please to rewrite the
    BUILD file with any changed hashes that it can find.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 id="fmt" class="title-2">plz fmt</h2>

  <p>a.k.a. <code class="code">plz format</code></p>

  <p>
    Auto-formats existing BUILD files. You can either provide a list of files to
    reformat or, if none are given, it will discover all BUILD files in the
    repository.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code class="code">-w</code> flag rewrites existing files in-place; if
    not passed the formatted version will be printed to stdout.
  </p>

  <p>
    The implementation is currently based on a lightly modified version of
    <a
      class="copy-link"
      href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      >buildifier</a
    >
    which supports nearly a superset of the same dialect, but lacks one or two
    features such as type annotations.<br />
    These are relatively rarely used in BUILD files though.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 id="init" class="title-2">plz init</h2>

  <p>
    Creates an initial (and pretty empty)
    <code class="code">.plzconfig</code> file in the current directory (or, if
    the <code class="code">--dir</code> flag is passed, somewhere else).
  </p>

  <p>You'll be warned before overwriting an existing file.</p>

  <p>
    It will also create a wrapper script,
    <code class="code">pleasew</code> which runs plz if found on the local
    machine, and otherwise attempts to download a copy. This can be handy for
    users who don't have it installed already.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a
    <code class="code">--bazel_compat</code> flag which initialises the config
    file for Bazel compatibility mode. This changes behaviour in various ways to
    make it easier to begin building an existing Bazel project - although more
    complex projects will still likely find things that don't translate easily.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 id="update" class="title-2">
    plz update
  </h2>

  <p>
    Updates plz to the appropriate version. This is quite tightly governed by
    the
    <code class="code">.plzconfig</code> file:
  </p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <span
        >If <code class="code">selfupdate</code> is true, then it's not normally
        necessary to run this since any invocation of plz will update before
        running. It will still behave as normal though if invoked
        explicitly.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        >If the <code class="code">version</code> property is set then it will
        attempt to download exactly that version, and fail if it can't for some
        reason.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        >Otherwise it will try to find the latest available version and update
        to that.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        >The <code class="code">downloadlocation</code> property determines
        where it tries to download from; by default it's the central plz site,
        but you could set this to a server of your own if you'd rather be more
        independent.</span
      >
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 id="gc" class="title-2">plz gc</h2>

  <p>
    Runs a basic "garbage collection" step, which attempts to identify targets
    that aren't in use. This is still fairly experimental since the definition
    of "not used" isn't always very clear (for example, ideally simply having a
    test on a library that isn't otherwise used would not be enough to keep both
    of those). Because of this it suggests a set of targets that it's pretty
    sure aren't used at all, and a secondary set that it's less sure on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now the name is a bit misleading since it finds but doesn't collect
    the garbage; ideally it'd be able to rewrite the BUILD files itself.
    Deleting sources is a little trickier since you'd often want to couple that
    with a VC operation (i.e.<code class="code">git rm</code>) and by design plz
    is unaware of the VCS in use.
  </p>

  <p>There are a few flags controlling it:</p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <div>
        <h3 class="mt1 f6 lh-title">
          <code class="code">-c, --conservative</code>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Uses a more conservative algorithm (specifically any tests will keep
          their targets).
        </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <h3 class="mt1 f6 lh-title">
          <code class="code">-t, --targets_only</code>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Only prints the targets to be removed (not sources). Useful to pipe
          them into another program.
        </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <h3 class="mt1 f6 lh-title">
          <code class="code">-t, --srcs_only</code>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Only prints the sources to be removed (not targets). Useful to pipe
          them into another program.
        </p>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 id="help" class="title-2">plz help</h2>

  <p>
    Displays help about a particular facet of Please. It knows about built-in
    build rules, config settings and a few other things. Mostly this is useful
    as an instant reference; you can run
    <code class="code">plz help topics</code> to get a list of all the topics
    that it knows about.
