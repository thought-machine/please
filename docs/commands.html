    <h1>Please commands</h1>

    <p>As you might expect, Please has a number of commands
      to invoke various behaviours. This is a more or less complete list.</p>

    <h2>Common flags</h2>

    <p>These flags are common to all (or nearly all) operations.</p>

    <h3>Options controlling what to build & how to build it:</h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>-c, --config</code><br/>
          The build config to use. The effect this has depends on the language; typically
          it allows swapping between a debug or an optimised build.<br/>
          The default is <code>opt</code> to build optimised code; <code>dbg</code> is accepted
          for C++ and Go to build code with debugging symbols.<br/>
          This has no effect on Python or Java rules.</li>

        <li><code>-r, --repo_root</code><br/>
          Sets the location of the repo root to use. Normally plz assumes it is within the repo
          somewhere and locates the root itself, this forces it to a specific location.</li>

        <li><code>-n, --num_threads</code><br/>
          Sets the number of parallel workers to use while building. The default is the number
          of logical CPUs of the current machine plus two.</li>

        <li><code>-i, --include</code><br/>
          Labels of targets to include when selecting multiple targets with <code>:all</code>
          or <code>/...</code>. These apply to labels which can be set on individual targets;
          a number of them are predefined, most notably for each language (<code>go</code>,
          <code>python</code>, <code>java</code>, <code>cc</code>, etc).<br/>
          Only targets with this label will be built.</li>

        <li><code>-e, --exclude</code><br/>
          The inverse of <code>--include</code>; labels of targets to exclude when
          selecting multiple targets with <code>:all</code> or <code>/...</code>.<br/>
          Takes priority over <code>--include</code>.<br/>
          You can also pass build expressions to <code>--exclude</code> to exclude targets
          as well as by label.</li>

        <li><code>-a, --arch</code><br/>
          Architecture to compile for. By default Please will build for the host architecture,
          but has some support for targeting others. See <a href="cross_compiling.html">the
          cross-compiling docs</a> for more information.</li>

        <li><code>-o, --override</code><br/>
          Allows overriding individual config settings on a temporary basis; for example
          <code>-o python.testrunner:pytest</code>. See the <a href="config.html">config
          reference</a> for more information on what can be overridden.</li>

        <li><code>--profile</code><br/>
          Defines a profile of config file to load from the repo. For example,
          <code>--profile ci</code> will load <code>.plzconfig.ci</code>. This can be useful to
          canonicalise certain settings for non-common or scripted configurations.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Options controlling output & logging:</h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>-v, --verbosity</code><br/>
          Sets the amount of output logged from plz; a number between 0 and 4.<br/>
          Each number shows all messages at the given level and above:
          <ol>
            <li>Error</li>
            <li>Warning</li>
            <li>Notice</li>
            <li>Info</li>
            <li>Debug</li>
          </ol>
          The default is 1, for warnings and errors only. If level 4 is requested then it
          will suppress interactive output.
        </li>

        <li><code>--log_file</code><br/>
          Writes all logs out into the given file.</li>

        <li><code>--log_file_level</code><br/>
          Level of logging to write to the file. Defaults to 2 (notice, warning and error).</li>

        <li><code>--interactive_output</code><br/>
          Forces plz to show interactive output on stderr. By default it autodetects based on
          whether stderr appears to be an interactive terminal or not, but this flag can be
          used to force it on in cases where it might get it wrong.</li>

        <li><code>-p, --plain_output</code><br/>
          Forces plz not to show interactive output on stderr. Can be useful in cases where it
          might obscure other messages or where the output isn't capable of interpreting the
          escape codes correctly.</li>

        <li><code>--colour</code><br/>
          Forces coloured output from logging & shell output. Again, this is autodetected by
          default, but this can be used in cases where it would normally detect false but it
          will later be consumed by something that understands the codes (e.g. CI systems like
          Teamcity or Jenkins).</li>

        <li><code>--nocolour</code><br/>
          Inverse of above, forces colourless output from logging & the shell.</li>

        <li><code>--trace_file</code><br/>
          File to write Chrome tracing output into.<br/>
          This is a JSON format that contains the actions taken by plz during the build and
          their timings. You can load the file up in <a href="about:tracing">about:tracing</a>
          and use that to see which parts of your build were slow.</li>

        <li><code>--version</code><br/>
          Prints the version of the tool and exits immediately.</li>

        <li><code>--show_all_output</code><br/>
          Prints all output of each building process as they run. Implies <code>--plain_output</code>.</li>

        <li><code>--completion_script</code><br/>
          Prints the bash / zsh completion script to stdout. This can be used in a <code>.bashrc</code>
        or <code>.zshrc</code>, e.g. <code>source <(plz --completion_script)</code>.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Options that enable / disable certain features:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><code>--noupdate</code><br/>
        Disables Please attempting to auto-update itself.</li>

      <li><code>--nocache</code><br/>
        Disables caches.<br/>
        Note that this does not disable incrementality, so targets that don't need rebuilding
        still won't be.</li>

      <li><code>--nohash_verification</code><br/>
        Turns hash verification errors into non-fatal warnings.<br/>
        Obviously this is only for local development & testing, not for 'production' use.</li>

      <li><code>--nolock</code><br/>
        Don't attempt to lock the repo exclusively while building.<br/>
        Use with care - if two instances of plz start building the same targets simultaneously
        they will likely fail with very strange errors.</li>

      <li><code>--keep_workdirs</code><br/>
        Don't clean directories in plz-out/tmp after successfully building targets.<br/>
        They're always left in cases where targets fail.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="build">plz build</a></h2>

    <p>This is the most common and obvious command; it builds one or more targets
      and all their dependencies. A plain <code>plz build</code> attempts to build
      everything, but more usually you can tell it to build a particular target
      or targets by passing them on the command line afterwards. For example:<br/>

      <code>plz build //src/core:core</code> builds just the one target.<br/>
      <code>plz build //src/core:all</code> builds every target in
          <code>src/core/BUILD</code>.<br/>
      <code>plz build //src/...</code> builds every target in <code>src</code>
      and all subdirectories.</p>

    <h2><a name="test">plz test</a></h2>

    <p>This is also a very commonly used command, it builds one or more targets and
      then runs their tests. Which tests to run are specified by positional arguments
      as described for <code>plz build</code>.</p>

    <p>After successful completion a combined test output file will be written to
      <code>plz-out/log/test_results.xml</code> in something approximating xUnit
      XML format.</p>

    <p>It takes a few special flags:
      <ul>
        <li><code>--num_runs</code><br/>
	  Determines how many times to run each test. The default is 1, but can be
	  more for tests marked as flaky.</li>
	<li><code>--failing_tests_ok</code><br/>
	  The return value is 0 regardless of whether any tests fail or not. It will
	  only be nonzero if they fail to build completely.<br/>
	  This is not commonly used, it's mostly useful for CI automation which will
	  parse the results file to determine ultimate success / failure.</li>
	<li><code>--test_results_file</code><br/>
	  Specifies the location to write the combined test results to.</li>
	<li><code>-d, --debug</code><br/>
	  Turns on interactive debug mode for this test. You can only specify one test
	  with this flag, because it attaches an interactive debugger to catch failures.<br/>
	  It only works for some test types, currently python (with pytest as the test runner),
	  C and C++.<br/>
	  It implies <code>-c dbg</code> unless that flag is explicitly passed.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2><a name="cover">plz cover</a></h2>

    <p>Very similar to <code>plz test</code>, but also instruments tests for coverage
      and collects results. Tests normally run significantly slower in this mode
      (the exact amount depends on the language).</p>

    <p>Coverage isn't available for C++ tests at present.</p>

    <p>All the same flags from <code>plz test</code> apply here as well. In addition
      there are several more:
      <ul>
	<li><code>--no_coverage_report</code><br/>
	  Suppresses the coverage report output to the shell.</li>
	<li><code>--line_coverage_report</code><br/>
	  Produces a line-by-line coverage display for all source files.</li>
	<li><code>--include_all_files</code><br/>
	  Includes any transitively dependent source files in the coverage report
	  (the default is just files from relevant packages).</li>
	<li><code>--include_file</code><br/>
	  Files to include in the coverage report (the flag can be passed more
	  than once for multiple).</li>
	<li><code>--coverage_results_file</code><br/>
	  Similar to <code>--test_results_file</code>, determines where to write
	  the aggregated coverage results to.</li>
	<li><code>-d, --debug</code><br/>
	  Turns on interactive debug mode for this test. You can only specify one test
	  with this flag, because it attaches an interactive debugger to catch failures.<br/>
	  It only works for some test types, currently python (with pytest as the test runner),
	  C and C++.<br/>
	  It implies <code>-c dbg</code> unless that flag is explicitly passed.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2><a name="run">plz run</a></h2>

    <p>This is essentially shorthand for calling <code>plz build</code> and then
      running the result of whatever target was built. It's often handy for iterating
      on a single target such that one command builds and reruns it.</p>

    <p>Because of the way the target is run after, you have to provide exactly one
      target to this command. The target must be marked as <code>binary</code> in its
      rule definition (this is implicit for the various builtin <code>_binary</code>
      rules such as <code>go_binary</code> etc).</p>

    <p>If you want to pass flags to the target rather than plz itself, you must pass
      them last on the command line, after a <code>--</code>. This tells Please not
      to attempt to parse them as its own flags.</p>

    <p>There are two optional subcommands <code>sequential</code> and <code>parallel</code>
      which allow running multiple targets in one go. As the names suggest, they run targets
      either one after the other or all in parallel.<br/>
      In either case, the semantics are a little different to running a single target; arguments
      must be passed one by one via the <code>-a</code> flag, and while stdout / stderr are
      connected to the current terminal, stdin is not connected (because it'd not be clear
      which process would consume it).</p>

    <h2><a name="watch">plz watch</a></h2>

    <p>Watches a set of targets for changes. Whenever any one of their source files (or that
      of any dependency) is changed, the targets will be rebuilt. If any of them are tests, then
      they will be run as well.</p>

    <p>Optionally you can pass the <code>--run</code> flag if you'd like the targets to be run
      (using <code>plz run</code>) instead of just built / tested.</p>

    <h2><a name="query">plz query</a></h2>

    <p>This allows you to introspect various aspects of the build graph. There are
      a number of subcommands identifying what you want to query for:
      <ul>
        <li><code>affectedtargets</code>: Prints any targets affected by a set of files.</li>
        <li><code>alltargets</code>: Lists all targets in the graph</li>
        <li><code>completions</code>: Prints possible completions for a string.</li>
        <li><code>deps</code>: Queries the dependencies of a target.</li>
        <li><code>graph</code>: Prints a JSON representation of the build graph.</li>
        <li><code>input</code>: Prints all transitive inputs of a target.</li>
        <li><code>output</code>: Prints all outputs of a target.</li>
        <li><code>print</code>: Prints a representation of a single target</li>
        <li><code>reverseDeps</code>: Queries all the reverse dependencies of a target.</li>
        <li><code>somepath</code>: Queries for a path between two targets</li>
        <li><code>rules</code>: Prints out a machine-parseable description of all currently known build rules.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Note that this is not the same as the query language accepted by Bazel and Buck,
      if you're familiar with those; generally this is lighter weight but less flexible
      and powerful. We haven't ruled out adding that in the future
      but have no concrete plans to do so at present.</p>

  <h2><a name="clean">plz clean</a></h2>

    <p>Cleans up output build artifacts and caches.</p>

    <p>This is not normally necessary since generally incrementality detection will ensure
      that targets are rebuilt if needed. It's possible though for particularly determined
      rules to do something they shouldn't in which case this might be needed, or
      (inconceivable though it is) a bug might exist that led to incorrect artifacts being
      cached.</p>

    <p>If given no arguments this cleans the entire plz-out directory and the directory
      cache, if configured. It returns immediately with the actual removal proceeding in
      the background; you can invoke other plz commands freely while that continues.<br/>
      You can pass the <code>--nobackground</code> flag if you'd prefer to wait though.</p>

    <p>If it's given targets to clean, it will need to perform a parse to work out what
      to clean, and will not return until those targets have been cleaned.</p>

    <p>The <code>--nocache</code> flag works like all other commands here, but bears
      mentioning since it will prevent artifacts from being removed from the cache
      (by default they're cleaned from there too).</p>

  <h2><a name="hash">plz hash</a></h2>

    <p>This command calculates the hash of outputs for one or more targets. These can
      then be passed in the <code>hash</code> or <code>hashes</code> attributes of
      those targets to verify their output is as expected - this is useful for
      fetching third-party dependencies to ensure they are not changing between builds.</p>

    <p>The relevant targets will be built in order to calculate the hash, but if they fail
      because it doesn't match the one recorded in the BUILD file plz will still exit
      successfully (although the output files will still not be created).</p>

    <p>One can of course achieve the same effect via running <code>plz build</code> and
      reading the actual hash when it fails, but this way is generally considered nicer.</p>

    <p>The <code>--update</code> flag will cause Please to rewrite the BUILD file with
      any changed hashes that it can find.</p>

  <h2><a name="init">plz init</a></h2>

    <p>Creates an initial (and pretty empty) <code>.plzconfig</code> file in the current
      directory (or, if the <code>--dir</code> flag is passed, somewhere else).</p>

    <p>You'll be warned before overwriting an existing file.</p>

    <p>It will also create a wrapper script, <code>pleasew</code> which runs plz if found
      on the local machine, and otherwise attempts to download a copy. This can be handy
      for users who don't have it installed already.</p>

    <p>There is a <code>--bazel_compat</code> flag which initialises the config file for
      Bazel compatibility mode. This changes behaviour in various ways to make it easier
      to begin building an existing Bazel project - although more complex projects will
      still likely find things that don't translate easily.</p>

  <h2><a name="update">plz update</a></h2>

    <p>Updates plz to the appropriate version. This is quite tightly governed by the
      <code>.plzconfig</code> file:
      <ul>
	<li>If <code>selfupdate</code> is true, then it's not normally necessary to run this
	  since any invocation of plz will update before running. It will still behave as
  	  normal though if invoked explicitly.</li>
	<li>If the <code>version</code> property is set then it will attempt to download
	  exactly that version, and fail if it can't for some reason.</li>
	<li>Otherwise it will try to find the latest available version and update to that.</li>
	<li>The <code>downloadlocation</code> property determines where it tries to download
	  from; by default it's the central plz site, but you could set this to a server of
	  your own if you'd rather be more independent.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <h2><a name="gc">plz gc</a></h2>

  <p>Runs a basic "garbage collection" step, which attempts to identify targets that
    aren't in use. This is still fairly experimental since the definition of "not used"
    isn't always very clear (for example, ideally simply having a test on a library that
    isn't otherwise used would not be enough to keep both of those). Because of this it
    suggests a set of targets that it's pretty sure aren't used at all, and a secondary
    set that it's less sure on.</p>

  <p>Right now the name is a bit misleading since it finds but doesn't collect the garbage;
    ideally it'd be able to rewrite the BUILD files itself. Deleting sources is a little
    trickier since you'd often want to couple that with a VC operation (i.e. <code>git rm</code>)
    and by design plz is unaware of the VCS in use.</p>

  <p>There are a few flags controlling it:
    <ul>
	  <li><code>-c</code>, <code>--conservative</code><br/>
	    Uses a more conservative algorithm (specifically any tests will keep their targets).</li>
	  <li><code>-t</code>, <code>--targets_only</code><br/>
	    Only prints the targets to be removed (not sources). Useful to pipe them into another program.</li>
	  <li><code>-t</code>, <code>--srcs_only</code><br/>
	    Only prints the sources to be removed (not targets). Useful to pipe them into another program.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2><a name="help">plz help</a></h2>

  <p>Displays help about a particular facet of Please. It knows about built-in build rules, config
    settings and a few other things. Mostly this is useful as an instant reference; you can run
    <code>plz help topics</code> to get a list of all the topics that it knows about.</p>

  <h2><a name="op">plz op</a></h2>

    <p>Re-runs whatever the previous command was.</p>
