    <h1>The BUILD language</h1>

    <p>Please's BUILD files typically contain a series of build rule declarations. These are
      invocations of builtins like <code>java_binary</code> which create new BUILD targets.</p>

    <p>However, you can do much more with it; it is a fully capable programming language with which
      it's possible to script the creation of build targets in elaborate ways. See
      <a href="#grammar">below</a> for a formal description of the grammar; it is a subset of
      Python so should be fairly familiar.</p>

    <p>You can do most things that one might expect in such a language; <code>for</code> and
      <code>if</code> statements, define functions, create lists and dicts, etc. Conventionally
      we keep complex logic in build_defs files but at present there is no difference in accepted
      syntax between the two.</p>

    <p>One obviously needs a mechanism to import new code; in Please that is <a href="lexicon.html#subinclude">subinclude</a>.
      This function takes the output of a build rule elsewhere in the repo and makes it available
      in the context of the currently executing file - for example, if it has defined a function,
      that function is now available in your BUILD file at the top level.</p>

    <p>See the <a href="/lexicon.html">built in rules &amp; languages</a> for a list of built in rules,
        as well as any <a href="/pleasings.html">extra rules</a> from the pleasings repo.</p>

    <h2>Types</h2>

    <p>The set of builtin types are again fairly familiar:
      <ul>
	<li><b>Integers</b> (all integers are 64-bit signed integers)</li>
	<li><b>Strings</b></li>
	<li><b>Lists</b></li>
	<li><b>Dictionaries</b></li>
	<li><b>Functions</b></li>
    <li><b>Booleans</b> (named <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>There are no floating-point numbers or class types. In some cases lists and dicts can be
      "frozen" to prohibit modification when they may be shared between files; that's done implicitly
      by the runtime when appropriate.</p>

    <p>Dictionaries are somewhat restricted in function; they may only be keyed by strings and cannot
      be iterated directly - i.e. one must use <code>keys()</code>, <code>values()</code> or
      <code>items()</code>. The results of all these functions are always consistently ordered.<br/>
      They support <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0584">PEP-584</a> style unions (although not the |= form).</p>

    <h2>Functions</h2>

    The build language has a rich set of builtin functions that largely resemble those provided by python. In
    addition to these, there are some additional built in functions specific to the Please domain. See the
    <a href="/lexicon.html#python-builtins">built in functions</a> documentation for more information.

    <h2>Style</h2>

    <p>We normally write BUILD files in an idiom which doesn't quite match standard Python styles.
      The justification is that these are mostly just inherited from working on Blaze, but a
      brief explanation follows after an example:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-plz">
      # Taken from //src/core/BUILD in the Please repo
      go_library(
          name = "core",
          srcs = glob(["*.go"], exclude=["*_test.go", "version.go"]) + [":version"],
          visibility = ["PUBLIC"],
          deps = [
              "//third_party/go:gcfg",
              "//third_party/go:logging",
              "//third_party/go:queue",
          ]
      )
    </code></pre>

    <p><b>All arguments to build rules are passed as keywords.</b> This is pretty important
      since (1) nobody will be able to read your BUILD file otherwise and (2) we don't guarantee
      not to change the order of arguments when we insert new ones. Fortunately Please will
      check this for you at runtime.</p>

    <p>Arguments to functions like <code>glob()</code> and <code>subinclude()</code> are not
      necessarily passed as keywords.</p>

    <p>We put spaces around the <code>=</code> for each argument to the build rule - we think it's
      easier to read this way.</p>

    <p>Either single or double quotes work, as usual, but don't mix both in one file. We usually
      prefer double because that's what Buildifier (see below) prefers.</p>

    <p>Lists either go all on one line:
      <pre><code class="language-plz">
      ["*_test.go", "version.go"]
      </code></pre>
      or are broken across multiple lines like so:
      <pre><code class="language-plz">
      [
          "//third_party/go:gcfg",
          "//third_party/go:logging",
          "//third_party/go:queue",
      ]
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>Indentation is normally four spaces. Tabs will be rejected by the parser.<br/>
      Dealing with indentation in a whitespace-significant language is tricky enough without
      introducing tabs to complicate the situation as well.</p>

    <p>We generally try to order lists lexicographically where it does not matter (for example
      <code>deps</code> or <code>visibility</code>).</p>

    <p>If you'd like an autoformatter for BUILD files, Google's
      <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildifier">Buildifier</a> is very good & fast.
      We use it both internally & on the Please repo.</p>

    <h2><a name="grammar">Grammar</a></h2>

    <p>The grammar is defined as (more or less) the following in EBNF, where <code>Ident</code>,
      <code>String</code>, <code>Int</code> and <code>EOL</code> are token types emitted by the lexer.</p>

    <pre><code>{{ .Grammar }}</code></pre>

    <p>As mentioned above, this is similar to Python but lacks the <code>import</code>, <code>try</code>,
      <code>except</code>, <code>finally</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>global</code>,
      <code>nonlocal</code>, <code>while</code> and <code>async</code> keywords. The implementation
      disallows using these as identifiers nonetheless since some tools might
      attempt to operate on the file using Python's <code>ast</code> module for convenience, which would not
      be possible if those keywords are used.<br/>
      As a result, while <code>raise</code> and <code>assert</code> <b>are</b> supported, it's
      not possible to catch and handle the resulting exceptions. These hence function only to
      signal an error condition which results in immediate termination.<br/>
      Note that <code>assert</code> is never optimised out, as it can be in Python.</p>

    <p>A more limited set of operators than in Python are available. The provided set are
      considered sufficient for use in BUILD files.</p>

    <p>Function annotations similar to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107">PEP-3107</a>
      / <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP-484</a> are available, although
      they have first-class meaning as type hints. The arguments are annotated with the expected
      type or types (separated by <code>|</code>) and when called the type of the argument will
      be verified to match. This makes it easier to give useful feedback to users if they
      make mistakes in their BUILD files (e.g. passing a string where a list is required).</p>

    <p>User-defined varargs and kwargs functions are not supported.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498">PEP-498</a> style "f-string" interpolation
      is available, but it is deliberately much more limited than in Python; it can only interpolate variable
      names rather than arbitrary expressions.</p>
