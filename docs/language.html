    <h1>The BUILD language</h1>

    <p>Please's BUILD files typically contain a series of build rule declarations. These are
      invocations of builtins like <code>java_binary</code> which create new BUILD targets.</p>

    <p>However, you can do much more with it; the syntax is actually a restricted Python subset
      so it's possible to script the creation of build targets in elaborate ways.</p>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>

    <p>Formally, the grammar for the BUILD files is defined as for Python since we interpret
      them as such (using <a href="http://pypy.org">PyPy</a>, as it happens). The only exceptions
      to this are that the <code>import</code>, <code>print</code> and <code>exec</code>
      keywords are disallowed. This means you can cheerfully have loops, classes, exceptions etc
      as you want.</p>

    <p>The reason these are disallowed is in an effort to keep BUILD file parsing reliable and
      efficient. Allowing import of arbitrary modules opens the door for all kinds of bad things
      to be done at parse time (we know, we did this in build systems we've used in the past
      and it did not have a happy ending). There are other solutions for these anyway (well not
      <code>exec</code>, but you weren't going to use that anyway, right?); see
      <code><a href="lexicon.html#subinclude">subinclude</a></code> and
      <code><a href="lexicon.html#log">log</a></code>.</p>

    <p>Similarly, a number of the standard builtins are not available; an incomplete list of these
      includes <code>execfile</code>, <code>eval</code>, <code>file</code> and <code>open</code>.<br/>
      Again, if BUILD files were able to open and read arbitrary files, it would be possible to
      do many bad things which would ultimately lead to builds being slow or unreliable.</p>

    <p>Note that BUILD files are parsed in-order, so invocations of functions that affect global
      defaults (notably <code><a href="lexicon.html#package">package</a></code>) will only
      affect build rules declared after them. However the rules themselves can be declared in any
      order, it isn't necessary to declare dependencies before rules that depend on them.</p>

    <h2>Style</h2>

    <p>We normally write BUILD files in a slightly non-standard idiom. The justification is that
      these are mostly just inherited from working on Blaze, but a brief explanation follows
      after an example:</p>

    <pre><code>
      # Taken from //src/core/BUILD in the Please repo
      go_library(
          name = 'core',
          srcs = glob(['*.go'], excludes=['*_test.go', 'version.go']) + [':version'],
          visibility = ['PUBLIC'],
          deps = [
              '//third_party/go:gcfg',
              '//third_party/go:logging',
              '//third_party/go:queue',
          ]
      )
    </code></pre>

    <p><b>All arguments to build rules are passed as keywords.</b>. This is pretty important
      since (1) nobody will be able to read your BUILD file otherwise and (2) while we don't
      normally change the order of function arguments, we might sometimes insert earlier ones
      which will break code using positional arguments.</p>

    <p>Arguments to functions like <code>glob()</code> and <code>subinclude()</code> are not
      necessarily passed as keywords.</p>

    <p>We put spaces around the <code>=</code> for each argument to the build rule.</p>

    <p>Either single or double quotes work, as usual, but don't mix both in one file.</p>

    <p>Lists either go all on one line:
      <pre><code>['*_test.go', 'version.go']</code></pre>
      or are broken across multiple lines like so:
      <pre><code>          [
              '//third_party/go:gcfg',
              '//third_party/go:logging',
              '//third_party/go:queue',
          ]</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>Indentation is normally four spaces.</p>

    <p>We generally try to order lists lexicographically but don't always get this 100%.</p>

    <p>There is no autoformatter for BUILD files at the moment; we've looked at building one
      but the built-in modules for Python don't work because they don't preserve comments.<br/>
      We'd like one someday though, several of us have fond memories of Google's one (and we
      live in hope of being able to borrow that!).</p>
