<h1 class="title-1">The BUILD language</h1>

<p>
  Please's BUILD files typically contain a series of build rule declarations.
  These are invocations of builtins like
  <code class="code">java_binary</code> which create new BUILD targets.
</p>

<p>
  However, you can do much more with it; it is a fully capable programming
  language with which it's possible to script the creation of build targets in
  elaborate ways. See <a class="copy-link" href="#grammar">below</a> for a
  formal description of the grammar; it is a subset of Python so should be
  fairly familiar.
</p>

<p>
  You can do most things that one might expect in such a language;
  <code class="code">for</code> and <code class="code">if</code> statements,
  define functions, create lists and dicts, etc. Conventionally we keep complex
  logic in build_defs files but at present there is no difference in accepted
  syntax between the two.
</p>

<p>
  One obviously needs a mechanism to import new code; in Please that is
  <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#subinclude">subinclude</a>. This
  function takes the output of a build rule elsewhere in the repo and makes it
  available in the context of the currently executing file - for example, if it
  has defined a function, that function is now available in your BUILD file at
  the top level.
</p>

<p>
  See the
  <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html">built in rules &amp; languages</a>
  for a list of built in rules, as well as any
  <a class="copy-link" href="/pleasings.html">extra rules</a> from the pleasings
  repo.
</p>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">Types</h2>

  <p>The set of builtin types are again fairly familiar:</p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <span
        ><strong>Integers</strong> (all integers are 64-bit signed
        integers)</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span><strong>Strings</strong></span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span><strong>Lists</strong></span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span><strong>Dictionaries</strong></span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span><strong>Functions</strong></span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <strong>Booleans</strong> (named <code class="code">True</code> and
        <code class="code">False</code>)</span
      >
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    There are no floating-point numbers or class types. In some cases lists and
    dicts can be "frozen" to prohibit modification when they may be shared
    between files; that's done implicitly by the runtime when appropriate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dictionaries are somewhat restricted in function; they may only be keyed by
    strings and cannot be iterated directly - i.e. one must use
    <code class="code">keys()</code>, <code class="code">values()</code> or
    <code class="code">items()</code>. The results of all these functions are
    always consistently ordered.<br />
    They support

    style unions (although not the |= form).

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">Functions</h2>

  <p>
    The build language has a rich set of builtin functions that largely resemble
    those provided by python. In addition to these, there are some additional
    built in functions specific to the Please domain. See the
    <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#python-builtins"
      >built in functions</a
    >
    documentation for more information.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">Style</h2>

  <p>
    We normally write BUILD files in an idiom which doesn't quite match standard
    Python styles. The justification is that these are mostly just inherited
    from working on Blaze, but a brief explanation follows after an example:
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    # Taken from //src/core/BUILD in the Please repo
    go_library(
        name = "core",
        srcs = glob(["*.go"], exclude=["*_test.go", "version.go"]) + [":version"],
        visibility = ["PUBLIC"],
        deps = [
            "//third_party/go:gcfg",
            "//third_party/go:logging",
            "//third_party/go:queue",
        ]
    )
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    <strong>All arguments to build rules are passed as keywords.</strong> This
    is pretty important since (1) nobody will be able to read your BUILD file
    otherwise and (2) we don't guarantee not to change the order of arguments
    when we insert new ones. Fortunately Please will check this for you at
    runtime.
  </p>

  <p>
    Arguments to functions like <code class="code">glob()</code> and
    <code class="code">subinclude()</code> are not necessarily passed as
    keywords.
  </p>

  <p>
    We put spaces around the <code class="code">=</code> for each argument to
    the build rule - we think it's easier to read this way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Either single or double quotes work, as usual, but don't mix both in one
    file. We usually prefer double because that's what Buildifier (see below)
    prefers.
  </p>

  <p>Lists either go all on one line:</p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    ["*_test.go", "version.go"]
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>or are broken across multiple lines like so:</p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    [
        "//third_party/go:gcfg",
        "//third_party/go:logging",
        "//third_party/go:queue",
    ]
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    Indentation is normally four spaces. Tabs will be rejected by the parser.<br />
    Dealing with indentation in a whitespace-significant language is tricky
    enough without introducing tabs to complicate the situation as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    We generally try to order lists lexicographically where it does not matter
    (for example <code class="code">deps</code> or
    <code class="code">visibility</code>).
  </p>

  <p>
    If you'd like an autoformatter for BUILD files, Google's

    is very good &amp; fast. We use it both internally &amp; on the Please repo.

    Grammar
  </h2>

  <p>
    The grammar is defined as (more or less) the following in EBNF, where
    <code class="code">Ident</code>, <code class="code">String</code>,
    <code class="code">Int</code> and <code class="code">EOL</code> are token
    types emitted by the lexer.
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code class="ph4 pv3">{{ .Grammar }}</code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    As mentioned above, this is similar to Python but lacks the
    <code class="code">import</code>, <code class="code">try</code>,
    <code class="code">except</code>, <code class="code">finally</code>,
    <code class="code">class</code>, <code class="code">global</code>,
    <code class="code">nonlocal</code>, <code class="code">while</code> and
    <code class="code">async</code> keywords. The implementation disallows using
    these as identifiers nonetheless since some tools might attempt to operate
    on the file using Python's <code class="code">ast</code> module for
    convenience, which would not be possible if those keywords are used.<br />
    As a result, while <code class="code">raise</code> and
    <code class="code">assert</code> <strong>are</strong> supported, it's not
    possible to catch and handle the resulting exceptions. These hence function
    only to signal an error condition which results in immediate termination.<br />
    Note that <code class="code">assert</code> is never optimised out, as it can
    be in Python.
  </p>

  <p>
    A more limited set of operators than in Python are available. The provided
    set are considered sufficient for use in BUILD files.
  </p>

  <p>
    Function annotations similar to
    <a
      class="copy-link"
      href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      >PEP-3107</a
    >
    /
    <a

      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      >PEP-484</a
    >
    are available, although they have first-class meaning as type hints. The
    arguments are annotated with the expected type or types (separated by
    <code class="code">|</code>) and when called the type of the argument will
    be verified to match. This makes it easier to give useful feedback to users
    if they make mistakes in their BUILD files (e.g. passing a string where a
    list is required).
  </p>

  <p>User-defined varargs and kwargs functions are not supported.</p>

    >
    style "f-string" interpolation is available, but it is deliberately much
    more limited than in Python; it can only interpolate variable names rather
    than arbitrary expressions.
