    <h1>The Lexicon of Please</h1>

    <p>This is the reference for the complete set of builtin rules & functions.</p>

    <h2><a name="builtins">Builtin functions</a></h2>

    <h3><a name="subinclude">subinclude</a></h3>

    <p><pre class="rule"><code>subinclude(target)</code></pre></p>

    <p>Includes the output of a build target as extra rules in this one.</p>

    <p>This is the closest equivalent to <code>import</code> in the BUILD language. It behaves
      somewhat differently though in that the contents of the subincluded file are added to the
      globals of the current module so can be called directly.</p>

    <p>The target that you attempt to subinclude is simply a normal build target, with the
      restriction that it must have exactly one output. The simplest form of this is a single-file
      <a href="#filegroup">filegroup</a> or <a href="export_file">export_file</a> rule, but
      it is possible to have more complex rules generating your BUILD definitions.</p>

    <p>For example:

    <pre><code>subinclude('//build_defs:my_build_rules')</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>Note that you can also <code>subinclude</code> remote files as follows:

    <pre><code>subinclude('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thought-machine/pleasings/master/grm/grm.build_defs')</code></pre>

    These are deduplicated internally so they're only downloaded & parsed once, so it's reasonably
    performant, although it's still often preferable to vendorise them yourself.</p>

    <h3><a name="glob">glob</a></h3>

    <p><pre class="rule"><code>glob(includes, excludes=None, hidden=False)</code></pre></p>

    <p>Matches all filenames by a pattern, in a manner reminiscent of shell-style pattern
      expansion or Python's builtin <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html">glob</a>
      module.</p>

    <p>Note that the only expansion patterns accepted are <code>*</code> to match an arbitrary
      number of non-separator characters (i.e. not <code>/</code>), and <code>**</code> to
      match any number of <b>complete</b> path components.<br/>
      These are often referred to as &quot;Ant-style&quot; patterns since Ant introduced them.</p>

    <p>It bears noting that you cannot glob generated files, only source files. Also glob will not
      descend into any directories that contain a BUILD file; this maintains an invariant that
      each file is owned by exactly one package (or potentially none, but then Please doesn't know
      or care about them). If you want to pull in files from another package, export them there
      using a <a href="#filegroup"><code>filegroup</code></a> and depend on that in the package
      you want it.</p>

      <tr>
	<td>exclude</td>
	<td>None</td>
	<td>list</td>
	<td>List of filenames to exclude from any patterns matched by <code>includes</code>.<br/>
      These are subject to glob expansion of <code>*</code> themselves, but
      <code>**</code> is <b>not</b> expanded (although since these are applied to each file found
      individually, it's not necessary).</td>

    <h3><a name="get_labels">get_labels</a></h3>

    <p><pre class="rule"><code>get_labels(target, prefix)</code></pre></p>

    <p>Gets the unique set of labels for a rule and all its transitive dependencies.</p>

    <p>Two formats are accepted for target: the first is a string containing just the target name,
      which is resolved in the current package. This facilitates calling them from a pre-build
      function, which is in fact the only time it's safe to call this way.<br/>
      The other is a full build target, which should be a transitive dependency of the target
      whose pre/post build function you're in. If the target isn't built when you ask for the
      labels the build will terminate.<br/>
      In either case this is only safe to call from a pre / post-build function and should
      never be called at initial parse time, because at that point you generally don't have
      the full set of labels available yet.</p>

    <p>Uses for this are normally fairly language-specific. The clearest example is maybe the
      builtin Python rules, where <code>python_binary</code> and <code>python_test</code> use
      this to identify if any of their dependencies have marked them as not being zip-safe.</p>

    <h3><a name="has_label">has_label</a></h3>

    <p><pre class="rule"><code>has_label(target, prefix)</code></pre></p>

    <p>Returns True if the target has any matching label that would be returned by get_labels.</p>

      <tr>
	<th>Argument</th>
	<th>Default</th>

    <h3><a name="package">package</a></h3>

    <p><pre class="rule"><code>package(**kwargs)</code></pre></p>

    <p>Defines settings affecting the current package - for example, default visibility.</p>

    <p>With this you can override any current value in <code>CONFIG</code> by name for all
      subsequent targets in the current package. Only existing values can be replaced.</p>

    <p>There are also a couple of special values which aren't normally in <code>CONFIG</code>:
      <code>default_licences</code> and <code>default_visibility</code>. As the names suggest
      these set defaults for those attributes for all following targets that don't set them.</p>

    <p>This function must be called <b>before</b> any targets are defined.</p>

    <h3><a name="log">log</a></h3>

    <p><pre class="rule"><code>log.warning(message, [args...])</code></pre></p>

    <p>Logs an arbitrary message at some given level. The available levels, from most quiet
      to most severe, are:
      <ul>
        <li><code>log.debug</code></li>
        <li><code>log.info</code></li>
        <li><code>log.notice</code></li>
        <li><code>log.warning</code></li>
        <li><code>log.error</code></li>
        <li><code>log.fatal</code></li>
      </ul>
      These correspond to Please's built in messages and are controlled as usual by the
      <code>-v</code> command-line argument.</p>

    <p>As the name suggests, <code>log.fatal</code> immediately terminates the program with
      a fatal error. The others have no side effect other than showing the message.</p>

    <p>The message and arguments together are interpolated like Python's normal string
      interpolation, similar to the builtin <code>logging</code> package.</p>

    <h3><a name="decompose">decompose</a></h3>

    <p><pre class="rule"><code>decompose(label)</code></pre></p>

    <p>Decomposes a build label into the package and name parts.</p>

    <p>Consider carefully when you should use this - command replacements may be more appropriate.<br/>
      Most rules should be able to accept labels without having to know anything about their structure.</p>

    <p>The input label can be given in either relative or absolute form. A ValueError will be
      raised if it's not a structurally valid label.</p>


    <h2><a name="cc">C and C++ rules</a></h2>

    <p>Rules to build C and C++ targets.</p>
    <p>The process of building C or C++ code is fairly complex so while these rules do their best
      to keep things reasonably simple, there's a lot of scope for things going wrong.</p>
    <p>There is very little difference between the <code>c_</code> and <code>cc_</code> variants
      of each rule, in nearly all cases they simply use different tools and flags in the
      <a href="config.html#cpp">relevant config section</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="go">Go rules</a></h2>

    <p>Rules to build Go code.</p>
    <p>Go has a strong built-in concept of packages so while it's not 100% required to strictly
      keep to 1 package per dir as in classic Go, it's still probably a good idea to match Please
      rules to Go packages.</p>

    <h2><a name="proto">Proto rules</a></h2>

    <p>Build rules for compiling protocol buffers & gRPC service stubs.</p>
    <p>Note that these are some of the most complex of our built-in build rules,
      because of their cross-language nature. Each proto_library rule declares a set of
      sub-rules to run protoc & the appropriate java_library, go_library rules etc. Users
      shouldn't worry about those sub-rules and just declare a dependency directly on
      the proto_library rule to get its appropriate outputs.</p>

    <h2><a name="python">Python rules</a></h2>

    <p>Rules to build Python code.</p>
    <p>The output artifacts for Python rules are .pex files (see https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex).</p>
    <p>Pex is a rather nice system for combining Python code and all needed dependencies
(excluding the actual interpreter and possibly some system level bits) into a single file.</p>
    <p>The process of compiling pex files can be a little slow when including many large files, as
      often happens when one's binary includes large compiled dependencies (eg. numpy...). Hence
      we have a fairly elaborate optimisation whereby each python_library rule builds a little
      zipfile containing just its sources, and all of those are combined at the end to produce
      the final .pex. This builds at roughly the same pace for a clean build of a single target,
      but is drastically faster for building many targets with similar dependencies or rebuilding
      a target which has only had small changes.</p>

    <h2><a name="sh">Shell rules</a></h2>

    <p>Rules to 'build' shell scripts.</p>
    <p>Note that these do pretty much nothing beyond collecting the files. In future we might
      implement something more advanced (ala .sar files or whatever).</p>
