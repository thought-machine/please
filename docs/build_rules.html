<h1>Writing build rules</h1>

<p>Please is designed to support interleaving custom build commands as first-class
  citizens in the system. This describes some of the concepts to bear in mind when
  writing rules of your own.</p>

<p>The documentation for <a href="lexicon.html#genrule">genrule()</a> and
  <a href="lexicon.html#gentest">gentest()</a> may be of use as well, as that explains the
  available arguments and what they do.</p>

<h2 id="example">Word count example</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a build rule. It takes in <code>example/file.txt</code> from the
  source tree and counts the number of words within:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-plz">
    # //example:word_count
    genrule(
      name = "word_count",
      srcs = ["file.txt"],
      outs = ["file.wordcount"],
      cmd = "wc $SRCS > $OUT",
    )
    </code></pre>

<p>Please sets up <code>$SRCS</code> and <code>$OUT</code> based on the parameters we passed
  to <code>genrule()</code>, then executes our command. When this rule builds, it will output
  <code>plz-out/gen/example/file.wordcount</code>. For more information on how this works, see
  the sources and outputs sections below.</p>

<h2 id="tmp-dir">Build location</h2>

<p>A core concept of Please is to try to isolate execution so we have a good concept of
  correctness for each action. To this end each rule builds in its own temporary directory
    (under <code>plz-out/tmp</code>) containing only files defined as inputs to the rule.</p>

<p>This means that you can't access any other files in your source tree from within the rule.
  If you want to have a look at what it looks like in there, <code>plz build --shell</code>
  will prepare a target for building and open up a shell into the directory, where you can
  look around and try running commands by hand.</p>

<p>Some aspects of this environment are different to normal - for example rules are given a
  small, deterministic set of environment variables. They shouldn't need to read anything
  outside this directory or not described by those variables. See the
  <a href="#pass-env">Passing environment variables</a> section of this page for more
  information on passing variables from the host machine to the rule.</p>


<h2 id="srcs">Sources</h2>

<p>Sources are the inputs to your rule - typically source code, but like any other inputs, they can also be build
  labels. This is defined in the <code>srcs</code> argument.</p>

<p>All sources are linked into the build directory - for performance reasons they aren't copied
  so you shouldn't modify them in-place.</p>

<p>Sources can be both files and directories, however it can be useful to use globs for sources e.g. to include all
  files with a given extension. See the <a href="/lexicon.html#please-builtins">built ins</a> for more information on
  this.</p>

<p>Sources can be referred through the <code>$SRCS</code> environment variable. If there's only
  one, <code>$SRC</code> will be defined too.<br/>
  Sources can also be named, e.g.
  <pre><code class="language-plz">
      srcs = {
          'srcs': ['my_source.py'],
          'resources': ['something.txt'],
      },
  </code></pre>
  In that case they can be accessed separately through <code>$SRCS_SRCS</code> and
  <code>$SRCS_RESOURCES</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="outs">Outputs</h2>
<p>Rules must define their outputs explicitly. Only these files will be saved to plz-out and
  made available to other rules.</p>
<p>The output location within plz-out depends on whether the rule is marked as binary. Binary
    rules output to <code>plz-out/bin/...</code> and non-binary rules output to
    <code>plz-out/gen/...</code>.</p>
<p>Like sources, outputs can be both files and directories. The simplest way to define outputs
  on a rule is as a list:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-plz">
      outs = [
        "path/to/a/directory",
        "foo.a",
      ],
  </code></pre>
<p>The <code>$OUT</code> and <code>$OUTS</code> variables will be set much like <a href="#srcs">sources</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="named-outs">Named outputs</h3>
<p>Much like sources, <code>outs</code> can also be a dictionary. In this case, the outputs are
    considered named outputs:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-plz">
      genrule(
          name = "my_rule",
          ...
          outs = {
              'src': ['src'],
              'lib': ['lib'],
          },
      )
  </code></pre>
<p>The variables <code>$OUTS_SRC</code> and <code>$OUTS_LIB</code> will be set. These outputs can then
  be depended on individually from other rules:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-plz">
      genrule(
          ...
          srcs = [":my_rule|srcs"],
          deps = ["my_rule|libs"],
          ...
      )
  </code></pre>

<h3 id="out-dirs">Output directories</h3>
<p>Sometimes it can be hard to reason about the exact outputs of a rule before actually building it.
  Output directories allow you to specify a folder; anything that ends up in that folder will become
  an output of the rule. The folder's path will not constitute part of the output path of the file.</p>

<p>Imagine we're generating code. The code generation tool parses some sources and based on the symbols
  it finds, produces a set of outputs e.g. mock generation:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-plz">
      genrule(
          name = "mocks",
          srcs = ["interfaces.go"],
          tools = {
              "mockgen": ["mockgen"],
          },
          cmd = "$TOOLS_MOCKGEN ... $SRCS -o $OUT"
          outs = ???,
      )
  </code></pre>
<p>It's difficult to know ahead of time which files mockgen is going to generate. It's dependent on
  the source code within <code>interfaces.go</code>. We can use output directories for this:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-plz">
      genrule(
          name = "mocks",
          srcs = ["interfaces.go"],
          tools = {
              "mockgen": ["mockgen"],
          },
          cmd = "mkdir _out && $TOOLS_MOCKGEN ... $SRCS -o _out"
          output_dirs = ["_out"],
      )
  </code></pre>
<p>If mockgen generates <code>foo_mocks.go</code> and <code>bar/bar_mocks.go</code>, these will
  become outputs of the rules as if they were defines as part of the <code>outs</code> list:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-plz">
        Build finished; total time 230ms, incrementality 100.0%. Outputs:
        //:mocks:
          plz-out/gen/foo_mocks.go
          plz-out/gen/bar
  </code></pre>
<p>If instead of the folder <code>plz-out/gen/bar</code>, it's preferable to have the output as
  <code>plz-out/gen/bar/bar_mocks.go</code>, you may add <code>**</code> to the output directory:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-plz">
      genrule(
          ...
          output_dirs = ["_out/**"],
      )
  </code></pre>
<p>This can be useful when these files are going to end up as <code>$SRCS</code> in another rule.
  Some tools don't deal well with directories e.g. <code>javac</code> in <code>java_library()</code></p>

<h2 id="deps">Dependencies</h2>

<p>Dependencies are other things you need in order to build - e.g. other code that your rule depends
  on.</p>
<p>These are also linked into the build directory, so the difference between sources and dependencies
  can seem arbitrary, but for some internal functions it's an important distinction to know how
  rules see the things they'll consume.</p>
<p>For example, the go compiler expects you to explicitly pass your sources (e.g.
  <code>go tool compile foo.go bar.go</code>), however it discovers its dependencies through
  configuration (e.g. by looking at the GOPATH).</p>

<p>As such, dependencies don't have any corresponding environment variables associated with them.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>Tools are the things that a rule uses to build with. They can refer either to other rules
  within the repo, or system-level binaries, for example:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-plz">
      tools = [
          'curl',
          '//path/to:tool',
      ],
  </code></pre>
  <p>In this example, <code>curl</code> is resolved on the system using the <code>PATH</code>
  variable defined in your <a href="config.html#build">.plzconfig file</a>. <code>//path/to:tool</code>
  will be built first and used from its output location.</p>
  <p>NB: For <code>gentest()</code>, there's also <code>test_tools</code> which behaves exactly the same,
    except is made available to <code>test_cmd</code> instead.</p>

<p>Tools are not copied into the build directory, you can access them using the <code>$TOOL</code>
  or <code>$TOOLS</code> environment variables. They can also be named in a similar manner to
  <a href="#srcs">sources</a>.</p>

<p>Note that since tools aren't copied, they can be a source of nondeterminism if you make use of
  other outputs that happen to be located near them. In order to ensure correctness you should
  make sure that you only run the tool itself and don't access neighbouring outputs.</p>

<p>The distinction between tools and other sources or dependencies is very important when
  using Please to <a href="cross_compiling.html">cross-compile</a> to a different target
  architecture. Tools will always be used from the host architecture (since they must be
  executed locally) whereas other dependencies will be for the target.</p>


<h2 id="cmd">Commands</h2>

<p>The command that you run is of course the core part of the rule. It can be passed to
  <code>genrule</code> in three formats:
  <ul>
    <li>As a string; the simplest format, since there's only one command that's run.</li>
    <li>As a list, it's a sequence of commands run one after another if the preceding ones are
      successful (i.e. it's effectively shorthand for <code>' && '.join(cmd)</code></li>
    <li>As a dict, the keys correspond to the build config to run and the values
      are the command to run in that config. The typical use case here is <code>opt</code> vs.
      <code>dbg</code> but arbitrary names can be given and specified with <code>plz build -c name</code>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>There are various special sequence replacements that the rule is subject to:
  <ul>
    <li><code>$(location //path/to:target)</code> expands to the location of the given build rule,
      which must have a single output only.</li>
    <li><code>$(locations //path/to:target)</code> expands to the locations of the outputs of the
      given build rule, which can have any number of outputs.</li>
    <li><code>$(dir //path/to:target)</code> expands to the directory containing the outputs of the
      given label</li>
    <li><code>$(out_dir //path/to:target)</code> expands to the directory containing the outputs of the
      given label with the preceding plz-out/{gen|bin}</li>
    <li><code>$(exe //path/to:target)</code> expands to a command to run the output of the given
      target. The rule must be marked as binary.</li>
    <li><code>$(out_exe //path/to:target)</code> expands to a command to run the output of the given
      target with the precdeing plz-out/{gen|bin}. The rule must be marked as binary.</li>
    <li><code>$(out_location //path_to:target)</code> expands to the output of the given build rule,
      with the preceding plz-out/{gen|bin}<br/>
      Consider carefully when to use this though; it is not normally useful.</li>
    <li><code>$(out_locations //path_to:target)</code> expands to the locations of the outputs of the
      given build rule, with the preceding plz-out/{gen|bin}. The rule can have any number of outputs.</li>
    <li><code>$(hash //path/to:target)</code> expands to a hash of the outputs of that target.<br/>
      This can be useful to uniquely fingerprint the given rule.</li>
    <li><code>$(worker //path/to:target)</code> invokes the given target as a
      <a href="workers.html">persistent worker</a>. See the linked page for more details on
      how to use them.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2 id="build-env">Build environment</h2>
<p>Please executes the build command in isolation. Typically, this means that rules cannot
  access files and environment variables that have not explcitly been made available to that
  rule.</p>
<p>The following environment variables are set by please before executing your command:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>ARCH</code>: architecture of the system, eg. amd64</li>
  <li><code>OS</code>: current operating system (linux, darwin, etc).</li>
  <li><code>PATH</code>: usual PATH environment variable as defined in your .plzconfig</li>
  <li><code>TMP_DIR</code>: the temporary directory you're compiling within.</li>
  <li><code>HOME</code>: also set to the temporary directory you're compiling within.</li>
  <li><code>NAME</code>: the name of the rule.
  <li><code>SRCS</code>: the sources of your rule</li>
  <li><code>OUTS</code>: the outputs of your rule</li>
  <li><code>PKG</code>: the path to the package containing this rule</li>
  <li><code>PKG_DIR</code>: Similar to <code>PKG</code> but always contains a path (specifically <code>.</code>
    if the rule is in the root of the repo).</li>
  <li><code>NAME</code>: the name of this build rule</li>
  <li><code>OUT</code>: the output of this rule. Only present when there is only one output.</li>
  <li><code>SRC</code>: the source of this rule. Only present when there is only one source.</li>
  <li><code>SRCS_&lt;suffix&gt;</code>: Present when you've defined named sources on a rule. Each group
    creates one of these these variables with paths to those sources.</li>
  <li><code>TOOLS</code>: Any tools defined on the rule.</li>
  <li><code>TOOL</code>: Available on any rule that defines a single tool only.</li>
  <li><code>SECRETS</code>: If any secrets are defined on the rule, these are the paths to them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pass-env">Passing environment variables</h3>
<p>By default, no environment variables from the host machine are available to rules. To make a
  variable available to the rule, set the <code>pass_env</code> parameter on <code>genrule()</code>
  and <code>gentest()</code>.</p>

<p>These variables will be made available to both <code>cmd</code> and <code>test_cmd</code>. They
  will also contribute to the rule hash, so if they change, the rule will be re-built and tested as
  appropriate.</p>

<p>NB: It's also possible to set environment variables to be passed globally to all rules in
  <code>.plzconfig</code>. See the <a href="/config.html#build">build</a> section in the config
  documentation for more information.</p>

<h3 id="secrets">Secrets</h3>

<p>Rules can define a list of secrets that they want access to. These are all absolute paths
  (beginning with <code>/</code> or <code>~</code> and aren't copied to the build directory;
  instead they can be located using the environment variable <code>$SECRETS</code>.<br/>
  They're useful for things like signing or access keys that you don't want to check into
  version control but still might be necessary for building some rules.</p>

<p>These don't contribute to the key used to retrieve outputs from the cache; this
  means it's possible for one machine to build a target with the secret and then
  share the output with others.</p>



<h2 id="entry-points">Entry points</h2>

<p>Some tools require resources to run. For example SDKs commonly have their compiler
  (and/or runtime) in a directory next to the SDK libraries. It can be hard to write
  a rule to execute this binary in this context. This is because binary rules have a
  single output whereas here we require the whole folder.</p>

<p> For example the java JDK has the following structure:</p>
  <pre><code>
      .../jdk
      |-- bin
      |   |-- java
      |   |-- javac
      |   |-- ...
      |-- lib
      |   |-- ...
      ...
  </code></pre>

<p>Using entry points, javac and java can be defined as such:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-plz">
      genrule(
          name = "jdk",
          cmd = "unzip jdk.zip -o $OUT"
          outs = ["out"],
          entry_points = {
            "java": "jdk/bin/java",
            "javac": "jdk/bin/javac",
          },
      )
  </code></pre>

<p>These entry points can then be used as tools by other rules, follwing a similar syntax to named
  outputs: </p>
  <pre><code class="language-plz">
      genrule(
          name = "java_lib",
          cmd = "$TOOLS_JAVAC ...",
          tools = {
            "javac": ":jdk|javac",
          },
      )
  </code></pre>

<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>As well as <code>genrule()</code>, there's also <a href="/lexicon.html#gentest">gentest()</a> which defines tests.
Test rules are very similar to other build rules in that they have a build step. This build step usually produces a
test binary which is then executed in the test step as defined by <code>test_cmd</code>:

  <pre><code class="language-plz">
      gentest(
          name = "some_test",
          ...
          cmd = "$TOOLS $SRCS -o $OUT", # compiles a binary that we can later run
          tools = [CONFIG.SOME_COMPILER], # Some sort of compiler e.g. gcc
          outs = ["test"],
          test_cmd = "$TEST > $RESULTS_FILE", # Execute the test. $TEST is set to the output of cmd
      )
  </code></pre>

<p>In this example, this rule will generate <code>test</code>, a binary containing our compiled tests. We then execute
this in test_cmd. The test output is piped to <code>test.results</code> as defined by the <code>$RESULTS_FILE</code>
variable.</p>

<p>For more information on testing in general, see <a href="/tests.html">Testing with Please</a>.</p>
