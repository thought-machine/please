<h1 class="title-1">Writing build rules</h1>

<p>
  Please is designed to support interleaving custom build commands as
  first-class citizens in the system. This describes some of the concepts to
  bear in mind when writing rules of your own.
</p>

<p>
  The documentation for
  <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#genrule">genrule()</a> and
  <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#gentest">gentest()</a> may be of use
  as well, as that explains the available arguments and what they do.
</p>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2" id="example">
    Word count example
  </h2>

  <p>
    Here is an example of a build rule. It takes in
    <code class="code">example/file.txt</code> from the source tree and counts
    the number of words within:
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    # //example:word_count
    genrule(
      name = "word_count",
      srcs = ["file.txt"],
      outs = ["file.wordcount"],
      cmd = "wc $SRCS &gt; $OUT",
    )
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    Please sets up <code class="code">$SRCS</code> and
    <code class="code">$OUT</code> based on the parameters we passed to
    <code class="code">genrule()</code>, then executes our command. When this
    rule builds, it will output
    <code class="code">plz-out/gen/example/file.wordcount</code>. For more
    information on how this works, see the sources and outputs sections below.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2" id="tmp-dir">
    Build location
  </h2>

  <p>
    A core concept of Please is to try to isolate execution so we have a good
    concept of correctness for each action. To this end each rule builds in its
    own temporary directory (under <code class="code">plz-out/tmp</code>)
    containing only files defined as inputs to the rule.
  </p>

  <p>
    This means that you can't access any other files in your source tree from
    within the rule. If you want to have a look at what it looks like in there,
    <code class="code">plz build --shell</code> will prepare a target for
    building and open up a shell into the directory, where you can look around
    and try running commands by hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some aspects of this environment are different to normal - for example rules
    are given a small, deterministic set of environment variables. They
    shouldn't need to read anything outside this directory or not described by
    those variables. See the
    <a class="copy-link" href="#pass-env">Passing environment variables</a>
    section of this page for more information on passing variables from the host
    machine to the rule.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2" id="srcs">Sources</h2>

  <p>
    Sources are the inputs to your rule - typically source code, but like any
    other inputs, they can also be build labels. This is defined in the
    <code class="code">srcs</code> argument.
  </p>

  <p>
    All sources are linked into the build directory - for performance reasons
    they aren't copied so you shouldn't modify them in-place.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sources can be both files and directories, however it can be useful to use
    globs for sources e.g. to include all files with a given extension. See the
    <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#please-builtins">built ins</a>
    for more information on this.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sources can be referred through the
    <code class="code">$SRCS</code> environment variable. If there's only one,
    <code class="code">$SRC</code> will be defined too.<br />
    Sources can also be named, e.g.
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    srcs = {
        'srcs': ['my_source.py'],
        'resources': ['something.txt'],
    },
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    In that case they can be accessed separately through
    <code class="code">$SRCS_SRCS</code> and
    <code class="code">$SRCS_RESOURCES</code>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2" id="outs">Outputs</h2>

  <p>
    Rules must define their outputs explicitly. Only these files will be saved
    to plz-out and made available to other rules.
  </p>

  <p>
    The output location within plz-out depends on whether the rule is marked as
    binary. Binary rules output to <code class="code">plz-out/bin/...</code> and
    non-binary rules output to <code class="code">plz-out/gen/...</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like sources, outputs can be both files and directories. The simplest way to
    define outputs on a rule is as a list:
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    outs = [
      "path/to/a/directory",
      "foo.a",
    ],
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    The <code class="code">$OUT</code> and
    <code class="code">$OUTS</code> variables will be set much like
    <a class="copy-link" href="#srcs">sources</a>.
  </p>

  <section class="mt4">
    <h3 class="title-3" id="named-outs">
      Named outputs
    </h3>

    <p>
      Much like sources, <code class="code">outs</code> can also be a
      dictionary. In this case, the outputs are considered named outputs:
    </p>

    <pre class="code-container">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <code data-lang="plz">
    genrule(
        name = "my_rule",
        ...
        outs = {
            'src': ['src'],
            'lib': ['lib'],
        },
    )
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      The variables <code class="code">$OUTS_SRC</code> and
      <code class="code">$OUTS_LIB</code> will be set. These outputs can then be
      depended on individually from other rules:
    </p>

    <pre class="code-container">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <code data-lang="plz">
    genrule(
        ...
        srcs = [":my_rule|srcs"],
        deps = ["my_rule|libs"],
        ...
    )
      </code>
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section class="mt4">
    <h3 class="title-3" id="out-dirs">
      Output directories
    </h3>

    <p>
      Sometimes it can be hard to reason about the exact outputs of a rule
      before actually building it. Output directories allow you to specify a
      folder; anything that ends up in that folder will become an output of the
      rule. The folder's path will not constitute part of the output path of the
      file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine we're generating code. The code generation tool parses some
      sources and based on the symbols it finds, produces a set of outputs e.g.
      mock generation:
    </p>

    <pre class="code-container">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <code data-lang="plz">
    genrule(
        name = "mocks",
        srcs = ["interfaces.go"],
        tools = {
            "mockgen": ["mockgen"],
        },
        cmd = "$TOOLS_MOCKGEN ... $SRCS -o $OUT"
        outs = ???,
    )
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      It's difficult to know ahead of time which files mockgen is going to
      generate. It's dependent on the source code within
      <code class="code">interfaces.go</code>. We can use output directories for
      this:
    </p>

    <pre class="code-container">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <code data-lang="plz">
    genrule(
        name = "mocks",
        srcs = ["interfaces.go"],
        tools = {
            "mockgen": ["mockgen"],
        },
        cmd = "mkdir _out &amp;&amp; $TOOLS_MOCKGEN ... $SRCS -o _out"
        output_dirs = ["_out"],
    )
     </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      If mockgen generates <code class="code">foo_mocks.go</code> and
      <code class="code">bar/bar_mocks.go</code>, these will become outputs of
      the rules as if they were defines as part of the
      <code class="code">outs</code> list:
    </p>

    <pre class="code-container">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <code data-lang="plz">
    Build finished; total time 230ms, incrementality 100.0%. Outputs:
    //:mocks:
      plz-out/gen/foo_mocks.go
      plz-out/gen/bar
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      If instead of the folder <code class="code">plz-out/gen/bar</code>, it's
      preferable to have the output as
      <code class="code">plz-out/gen/bar/bar_mocks.go</code>, you may add
      <code class="code">**</code> to the output directory:
    </p>

    <pre class="code-container">
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <code data-lang="plz">
    genrule(
        ...
        output_dirs = ["_out/**"],
    )
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      This can be useful when these files are going to end up as
      <code class="code">$SRCS</code> in another rule. Some tools don't deal
      well with directories e.g. <code class="code">javac</code> in
      <code class="code">java_library()</code>
    </p>
  </section>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2" id="deps">
    Dependencies
  </h2>

  <p>
    Dependencies are other things you need in order to build - e.g. other code
    that your rule depends on.
  </p>

  <p>
    These are also linked into the build directory, so the difference between
    sources and dependencies can seem arbitrary, but for some internal functions
    it's an important distinction to know how rules see the things they'll
    consume.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, the go compiler expects you to explicitly pass your sources
    (e.g. <code class="code">go tool compile foo.go bar.go</code>), however it
    discovers its dependencies through configuration (e.g. by looking at the
    GOPATH).
  </p>

  <p>
    As such, dependencies don't have any corresponding environment variables
    associated with them.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2" id="tools">Tools</h2>

  <p>
    Tools are the things that a rule uses to build with. They can refer either
    to other rules within the repo, or system-level binaries, for example:
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    tools = [
        'curl',
        '//path/to:tool',
    ],
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    In this example, <code class="code">curl</code> is resolved on the system
    using the <code class="code">PATH</code> variable defined in your
    <a class="copy-link" href="/config.html#build">.plzconfig file</a>.
    <code class="code">//path/to:tool</code> will be built first and used from
    its output location.
  </p>

  <p>
    NB: For <code class="code">gentest()</code>, there's also
    <code class="code">test_tools</code> which behaves exactly the same, except
    is made available to <code class="code">test_cmd</code> instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tools are not copied into the build directory, you can access them using the
    <code class="code">$TOOL</code> or
    <code class="code">$TOOLS</code> environment variables. They can also be
    named in a similar manner to <a class="copy-link" href="#srcs">sources</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that since tools aren't copied, they can be a source of nondeterminism
    if you make use of other outputs that happen to be located near them. In
    order to ensure correctness you should make sure that you only run the tool
    itself and don't access neighbouring outputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The distinction between tools and other sources or dependencies is very
    important when using Please to
    <a class="copy-link" href="/cross_compiling.html">cross-compile</a>
    to a different target architecture. Tools will always be used from the host
    architecture (since they must be executed locally) whereas other
    dependencies will be for the target.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2" id="cmd">Commands</h2>

  <p>
    The command that you run is of course the core part of the rule. It can be
    passed to <code class="code">genrule</code> in three formats:
  </p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <span>
        As a string; the simplest format, since there's only one command that's
        run.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        As a list, it's a sequence of commands run one after another if the
        preceding ones are successful (i.e. it's effectively shorthand for
        <code class="code">' &amp;&amp; '.join(cmd)</code>
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        As a dict, the keys correspond to the build config to run and the values
        are the command to run in that config. The typical use case here is
        <code class="code">opt</code> vs. <code class="code">dbg</code> but
        arbitrary names can be given and specified with
        <code class="code">plz build -c name</code>.
      </span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    There are various special sequence replacements that the rule is subject to:
  </p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">$(location //path/to:target)</code> expands to the
        location of the given build rule, which must have a single output only.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">$(locations //path/to:target)</code> expands to the
        locations of the outputs of the given build rule, which can have any
        number of outputs.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">$(dir //path/to:target)</code> expands to the
        directory containing the outputs of the given label
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">$(out_dir //path/to:target)</code> expands to the
        directory containing the outputs of the given label with the preceding
        plz-out/{gen|bin}
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">$(exe //path/to:target)</code> expands to a command
        to run the output of the given target. The rule must be marked as
        binary.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">$(out_exe //path/to:target)</code> expands to a
        command to run the output of the given target with the precdeing
        plz-out/{gen|bin}. The rule must be marked as binary.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">$(out_location //path_to:target)</code> expands to
        the output of the given build rule, with the preceding
        plz-out/{gen|bin}<br />
        Consider carefully when to use this though; it is not normally useful.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">$(out_locations //path_to:target)</code> expands to
        the locations of the outputs of the given build rule, with the preceding
        plz-out/{gen|bin}. The rule can have any number of outputs.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">$(hash //path/to:target)</code> expands to a hash of
        the outputs of that target.<br />
        This can be useful to uniquely fingerprint the given rule.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <code class="code">$(worker //path/to:target)</code> invokes the given
        target as a

    <p>
      By default, no environment variables from the host machine are available

      re-built and tested as appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
      NB: It's also possible to set environment variables to be passed globally

      Rules can define a list of secrets that they want access to. These are all
      absolute paths (beginning with <code class="code">/</code> or
      <code class="code">~</code> and aren't copied to the build directory;

      some rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      These don't contribute to the key used to retrieve outputs from the cache;
      this means it's possible for one machine to build a target with the secret

  <p>
    Some tools require resources to run. For example SDKs commonly have their
    compiler (and/or runtime) in a directory next to the SDK libraries. It can
    be hard to write a rule to execute this binary in this context. This is
    because binary rules have a single output whereas here we require the whole
    folder.
  </p>

  <p>For example the java JDK has the following structure:</p>

  <p>Using entry points, javac and java can be defined as such:</p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    genrule(
        name = "jdk",
        cmd = "unzip jdk.zip -o $OUT"
        outs = ["out"],
        entry_points = {
          "java": "jdk/bin/java",
          "javac": "jdk/bin/javac",
        },
    )
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    These entry points can then be used as tools by other rules, follwing a
    similar syntax to named outputs:
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    genrule(
        name = "java_lib",
        cmd = "$TOOLS_JAVAC ...",
        tools = {
          "javac": ":jdk|javac",
        },
    )
    </code>

  <p>
    As well as <code class="code">genrule()</code>, there's also
    <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#gentest">gentest()</a>
    which defines tests. Test rules are very similar to other build rules in
    that they have a build step. This build step usually produces a test binary
    which is then executed in the test step as defined by
    <code class="code">test_cmd</code>:
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    gentest(
        name = "some_test",
        ...
        cmd = "$TOOLS $SRCS -o $OUT", # compiles a binary that we can later run
        tools = [CONFIG.SOME_COMPILER], # Some sort of compiler e.g. gcc
        outs = ["test"],
        test_cmd = "$TEST &gt; $RESULTS_FILE", # Execute the test. $TEST is set to the output of cmd
    )
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    In this example, this rule will generate <code class="code">test</code>, a
    binary containing our compiled tests. We then execute this in test_cmd. The
    test output is piped to <code class="code">test.results</code> as defined by
    the <code class="code">$RESULTS_FILE</code> variable.
