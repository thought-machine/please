    Can I run it on my computer?
  </h2>

  <p>
    If you're running Linux, macOS or FreeBSD, definitely; we actively support
    those platforms.<br />
    Installing Please on either Linux or macOS is as easy as
    <code class="code">curl https://get.please.build | bash</code>. Further
    dependencies shouldn't be necessary after that, assuming you have what you
    need for the languages you want to work on (e.g. you'll need a JDK to use
    Please for Java).
  </p>

  <p>
    To compile it, one only needs Go and Git installed.<br />
    On Linux we primarily support Ubuntu; it should work pretty readily on most
    distros though.<br />

    for information and a Dockerfile for setting up a recommended environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    For building on FreeBSD, you will need to install Bash as well.<br />
    Currently binary downloads aren't available, we hope to make them available
    in future.

  <p>
    Windows is unfortunately not supported natively, since it's just too
    different from the Unix environment Please is designed for. It is possible
    to run it within

    Why use Please instead of go build / Maven / Gradle?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Cross-language support is a big advantage; we have four main languages in
    use at Thought Machine (Javascript, Python, Java and Go) plus several
    smaller pieces (some C++ and Thrax grammars) and having to invoke different
    compilers and/or test tools for each one would be extremely tiresome.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please can also integrate many different kinds of build steps; for example a
    code generation step using <code class="code">go generate</code> or
    <code class="code">protoc</code> can be invoked dynamically without having
    to check the resulting code into the repository.
  </p>

  <p>
    We've tried other tools (notably Gradle and Buck) internally and ultimately
    decided that we could build something that would either better fit our
    needs, be considerably faster, or both.
  </p>
</section>

  <h2 class="title-2">
    Why use Please instead of Bazel, Buck or Pants?
  </h2>

  <p>
    All four of these systems are quite closely related in the scheme of things,
    being inspired by (or in Bazel's case, a direct open sourcing of) Google's
    Blaze.
  </p>

  <p>
    Several of us had worked at Google and used Blaze extensively there; we were
    excited about it being open sourced as Bazel but by then we were already
    using Please internally. It's a great system but we have slightly different
    goals, specifically we're aiming Please at being lighter weight and pushing
    the boundaries of what can be done within the BUILD language. Since Please
    is written in Go there's no runtime dependency on the JVM.
  </p>

  <p>
    We actually used Buck for some months internally before deciding to write
    Please and before it was capable of building our repo. We preferred it to
    other options available, but again we're focused on different goals; Please
    is easier to extend to new languages, has a bunch of features that we
    specifically wanted (e.g. test sandboxing) and has a stronger focus on BUILD
    language correctness. Conversely we have much less support for mobile
    development.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're least familiar with Pants; one of our developers briefly tried it and
    while we liked many aspects we didn't think it was the ideal fit for us at
    the time.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">
    What inspired the design of Please?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Originally Blaze, since a number of us had used it at Google. More recently
    we'd used Buck internally so many things superficially resemble that for
    compatibility reasons (e.g. <code class="code">python_binary</code> instead
    of <code class="code">py_binary</code> etc).
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of the advanced features are based on things we would have liked to do
    with Blaze, for example being able to defer creation of some build rules
    until they actually need to be built. This is only really of interest for
    spectacularly large trees of targets or especially esoteric use cases
    though.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mostly, of course, it was inspired by our fearless leader Paul, specifically
    the point when he told us "you absolutely cannot write your own build
    system". After that it was really inevitable...
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">Why is it so fast?</h2>

  <p>
    Firstly, all the rules explicitly declare their dependencies, so Please can
    aggressively parallelise build rules wherever possible. It can also cache
    &amp; reuse previous outputs when they haven't changed, and it hashes all
    input files to make sure it's correct.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also BUILD files encourage you to break projects into smaller components,
    which can then be compiled in parallel. It's still possible to define a
    project with a single BUILD file in the traditional Java way that one would
    use in Gradle etc, and this works fine for smaller projects, but for larger
    ones parallelising the compilation can be a big advantage.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are no separate steps inside Please; parsing BUILD files, building
    targets and running tests can all happen simultaneously, so there's no down
    time waiting for the last thing to compile before the tests begin. The
    parsing process is also very fast due to having an in-process Python
    interpreter.
  </p>

  <p>
    It being written in Go and being an entirely native binary means great
    performance and fast startup times; internally it's also highly parallelised
    and can take full advantage of the underlying hardware.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, the rules themselves are optimised in various ways; for example,
    the construction of the final .jar from a
    <code class="code">java_binary</code> is an efficient concatenation of other
    .jar files without any recompression. Similarly the output .pex from a
    <code class="code">python_binary</code> is built up piecemeal throughout the
    <code class="code">python_library</code> rules and assembled at the end so
    we don't have to recompress an entire zip file every time you change one .py
    file.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">
    How do you parse the BUILD files? What format are they?
  </h2>

  <p>
    The currently-unnamed BUILD language is a restricted subset of Python; see
    <a class="copy-link" href="/language.html">here</a> for more details,
    documentation and a formal grammar.
  </p>

  <p>
    This provides a nice balance between an elegant and powerful language, but
    also one that can be interpreted more easily than Python itself, and that is
    reasonably familiar to many developers.
  </p>

  <p>
    One downside to this is that the BUILD files are a little hard to
    automatically edit or update compared to a data format like XML, Yaml or
    JSON. We think this is worth the tradeoff for giving the developer more
    power and (in our opinion) a significantly nicer format.<br />
    A few Please features can help with updating BUILD files:
  </p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <span>
        <a class="copy-link" href="/commands.html#fmt">plz fmt</a> to autoformat
        your BUILD files
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <a class="copy-link" href="/commands.html#hash">plz hash --update</a>
        to automatically update hashes
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <a class="copy-link" href="/commands.html#gc">plz gc</a> to clean up
        unused targets
      </span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">
    Okay, but what exactly are you using to parse the files?
  </h2>

  <p>
    The built-in parser is an internal pure Go implementation. It's evolved
    through several implementations over time; ultimately this provides maximum
    control and performance (because we are not subject to Python's GIL, or cgo
    calling overhead).
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">
    How does Please build itself? Do I need Please to build Please?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Please bootstraps itself using <code class="code">go build</code> to build a
    temporary version of itself, which is then used to rebuild itself using its
    own BUILD rules. This requires disabling some features for that bootstrap
    step (mostly codegen steps), but is definitely worth it since obviously we
    can't rely on anyone building it already having a version of it installed.
  </p>

  <p>Fortunately the process is pretty fast since Go is fast to compile.</p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">Why write it in Go?</h2>

  <p>
    We excluded most other languages that any of us were familiar with through a
    process of elimination; JVM languages were ruled out from a concern about
    startup overhead, we were concerned about Python's threading performance for
    an inherently parallel system and felt C++ was too fiddly and lacked a
    strong standard library. Rust was still pre-1.0 at the time (although that
    didn't take long, as it turned out) so we felt it was a bit early to leap
    into that.
  </p>

  <p>
    It also turned out to be a really useful way of learning the language; the
    project is about the right size to explore it properly and sufficiently
    self-contained not to affect other parts of our repo until we were sure Go
    was a language we wanted to do more of.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're very happy with the results; the performance of native binaries is
    excellent, the language was easy to become productive with and has great
    support for all the things we needed to do with it. Our early concerns (e.g.
    the classic &quot;no generics!&quot;) turned out to be a lot less
    problematic than we expected.
  </p>

  <p>
    An alternative explanation is that the original high-level design meeting
    for Please was an impromptu discussion in a pub one Friday evening, where we
    thought it would be a neat language to try despite none of us having any
    real experience with it.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">
    Is this the primary repo, or do you have a secret internal version too?
  </h2>

  <p>
    This is the only repository; all development is done here. Initially we had
    an internally hosted repo but transferred the project to Github in
    preparation for open sourcing it.
  </p>

  <p>
    We've got some build rules in our internal repo that aren't built into
    Please yet. We intend to open source as we can, but the ones left aren't
    easy to genericise for various reasons.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are some additional rules available at
    <a
      class="copy-link"
      href="https://github.com/thought-machine/pleasings"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      >https://github.com/thought-machine/pleasings</a
    >, which we either do not want to guarantee compatibility for, are still
    experimental, or are sufficiently esoteric that we don't want the build
    process for Please to require them.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">
    How does the versioning scheme work? What are the compatibility guarantees?
  </h2>

  <p>
    We are using
    <a class="copy-link" href="http://semver.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      >semantic versioning</a
    >
    so essentially:
  </p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <span>
        Changes to the major version number mean you might have to make an
        active change to your BUILD files or project config.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Changes to the minor version number indicate additional features that
        shouldn't require any changes on your part.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Changes to the patch version number are bugfixes.
      </span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These rules apply to the "public parts" of the project; specifically the
    command-line interface and flags, the config file format and the BUILD file
    format and builtins are essentially the API and so we take significantly
    more care about compatibility around those.<br />
    The interface to the various sub-tools invoked by Please we consider an
    implementation detail and those might change more aggressively (although in
    practice they rarely do).
  </p>

  <p>
    Things whose behaviour is not explicitly specified might change with less
    notice, because of course you shouldn't have been relying on it anyway. This
    includes the exact hash generation method - if it becomes necessary to
    change that for a bugfix it may force apparently unnecessary rebuilds after
    an update. We try to avoid that as much as possible since it's aggravating
    (for us too!) but since it doesn't affect eventual correctness it can change
    in minor releases.
  </p>

  <p>
    The versions don't apply to the code interfaces themselves, since we don't
    expect this to see wide use as a library. If some part of it becomes popular
    in that way we'll likely split it out to a separate repository and version
    it separately.
  </p>

  <h2 class="title-2">
    What does it look like when I'm running it?
  </h2>

  <p>Like this:</p>

  <asciinema-player
    src="https://please.build/plz-recording.json"
  ></asciinema-player>

  <p>
    The appearance is somewhat inspired by Buck, although we have put some of
    our own spin on it as well.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">
    What do the colours in the console output mean?
  </h2>

  <p>They change based on the type of rule that's being built:</p>

  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <span>
        Yellow: Go
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Green: Python
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Red: Java
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Blue: Javascript
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Cyan: Parsing a BUILD file
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Magenta: Third party dependencies
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        White: Anything else.
      </span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Libraries are normal weight, binaries (including tests) are bold.</p>

  <p>
    There is absolutely no significance to the choice of colours beyond
    arbitrary choice when that code was originally written.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">
    Why's it called Please?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Because we liked the idea of sounding polite when typing "plz build", "plz
    test", etc.<br />
    Also we chose the domain name before almost anything else (priorities!).
  </p>
