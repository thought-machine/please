<h1 class="title-1">Pre- and post-build functions</h1>

<p>
  It's possible in Please to define callbacks into the build language that are
  invoked either immediately before or immediately after the target is built.
  These allow modifying aspects of the target or the wider build graph which can
  potentially be a powerful tool to handle things that are otherwise awkward or
  impossible.
</p>

<p>
  Note that these functions are only evaluated at build time, so their results
  will not be visible to <code class="code">plz query</code>, they impose
  additional actions that must happen at each build (even if the target has not
  built, the same effects must happen) and they can be a little hard to debug if
  you get things wrong. They should hence be used judiciously.

    Pre-build function
  </h2>

  <p>
    The pre-build function is defined on a
    <code class="code">build_rule</code> as simply:
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    pre_build = lambda name: do_stuff(name)
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    As you can see, it's invoked with one argument, the name of the rule about
    to be built. It's up to you what you do in the function, although in
    practice the only really useful thing at present is to inspect the rule's
    transitive labels and adjust its build command accordingly. This is done via
    calling <code class="code">get_labels(name, prefix)</code> where
    <code class="code">name</code> is the name of the current rule and
    <code class="code">prefix</code> is a prefix the labels you're interested in
    will have (for convenience, it's stripped from the returned values). Having
    got these, one can then call
    <code class="code">set_command(name, cmd)</code> to alter the command for
    your rule.
  </p>

  <p>
    The built-in C++ rules for Please (<code class="code"
      ><a
        class="copy-link"
        href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/blob/master/rules/cc_rules.build_defs"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        >rules/cc_rules.build_defs</a
      ></code
    >) are a reasonably good example of how to use this.
  </p>

  <h2 class="title-2">
    Post-build function
  </h2>

  <p>
    The post-build function is somewhat more powerful and useful than the
    pre-build function, and hence it appeared in the API several months sooner.
    It is defined similarly:
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    post_build = lambda name, output: do_stuff(output)
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    but takes an extra output which is the standard output of the build rule
    after successful invocation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The power of this is that you can run a build rule to do arbitrary
    operations and then alter the build graph based on that; you can add outputs
    to the rule, define new rules and add dependencies to a rule.
  </p>

  <p>
    One useful example is collecting additional output files. This happens with
    Java protobuf outputs where the output files are not obvious until the
    .proto file is parsed, because their location is defined by the
    <code class="code">option java_package</code> stanza. One could of course
    require them to be explicitly defined but that rapidly becomes tedious; the
    nicer solution is detecting it this way. The build rule simply invokes
    <code class="code">find</code> to locate all the
    <code class="code">.java</code> files it produces and the post-build
    function receives those and runs
    <code class="code">add_out(name, java_file)</code> for each.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another is adding entirely new rules to the build graph dynamically. This is
    done in the
    <code class="code"
      ><a
        class="copy-link"
        href="https://github.com/thought-machine/pleasings/blob/master/java/maven_jars.build_defs"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        >maven_jars</a
      ></code
    >
    add-on rule, which derives the set of transitive dependencies for a set of
    Maven coordinates then creates rules dynamically based on that. This is done
    simply by calling functions to create build rules as normal; one must finish
    it off by using <code class="code">add_dep</code> to add dependencies on
    them from other build rules (since otherwise nothing can depend on them and
    they'll hence never get built).

    Hints
  </h2>

  <p>
    As mentioned above, be judicious in the use of these callbacks. They add
    some overhead and are more complex to reason about than totally static build
    targets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the target supplying the post-build function must produce
    consistent output - since they are bringing input from outside the build
    language it's a possible source of nondeterminism. It's possible to run into
    awkward situations around caching etc (normally indicated by some mildly
    scary warnings from plz) if done wrong.<br />
    A common mistake here is using <code class="code">find</code> to locate
    files without <code class="code">sort</code> to ensure they're in a
    consistent order.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need to debug your rules via
    <code class="code">plz query print</code> or similar, there is a
    <code class="code">--pre</code> flag that can be given to force building a
    target before the query is run. That can be useful to ensure the target you
    want to debug is generated before we attempt to print it.
