<h1 class="title-1">Please cache</h1>

<p>
  In various places in these docs you might find reference to caches. Please can
  make use of several caches to speed up its performance which are described
  here.
</p>

<p>
  Not that caches are different from the output in
  <code class="code">plz-out</code>. Even without caching, please will still
  reuse built artifacts from <code class="code">plz-out</code> for incremental
  builds. Please has strict caching and incrementality behavior. With that said,
  you can still force a rebuild or a test rerun, use the
  <code class="code">--rebuild</code> and
  <code class="code">--rerun</code> flags respectively.
</p>

<p>
  In all cases artifacts are only stored in the cache after a successful build
  or test run.

  <h2 class="title-2">The directory cache</h2>

  <p>
    This is the simplest kind of cache; it's on by default and simply is a
    directory tree (by default <code class="code">~/.cache/please</code> or
    <code class="code">~/Library/Caches/please</code>) containing various
    versions of built artifacts. The main advantage of this is that it allows
    extremely fast rebuilds when swapping between different versions of code
    (notably git branches).
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the dir cache is <b>not</b> threadsafe or locked in any way beyond
    plz's normal repo lock, so sharing the same directory between multiple
    projects is probably a Bad Idea.
  </p>

<section class="mt4">
  <h2 class="title-2">The HTTP cache</h2>

  <p>
    This is a more advanced cache which, as one would expect, can run on a
    centralised machine to share artifacts between multiple clients. It has a
    simple API based on PUT and GET to store and retrieve opaque blobs.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is simply configured by setting the
    <code class="code">httpurl</code> property in the
    <a class="copy-link" href="/config.html#cache"
      >cache section of the config</a
    >. There are a couple more settings to configure it for readonly mode and to
    set timeouts etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since the API is simple there are many existing servers that can be
    configured for a backend; one option is nginx using its
    <a
      class="copy-link"
      href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_dav_module.html"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      >webDAV</a
    >
    module.<br />
    Alternatively some CI services (for example
    <a
      class="copy-link"
      href="https://cirrus-ci.org"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      >Cirrus</a
    >) may offer a compatible cache out of the box.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks to Diana Costea who implemented the original version of this as part
    of her internship with us, and prodded us into getting on and actually
    deploying it for our CI servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    A reference implementation of the http cache can be found
    <a
      class="copy-link"
      href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/tree/master/tools/http_cache"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      >here</a
    >
    however it should be possible to use any off the shelf http server with a
    little configuration, as described above.

  <h2 class="title-2">Scriptable, command driven, cache</h2>

  <p>
    You can realize a centralised cache also by managing the remote access
    part in external commands or scripts. Please will simply invoke the 
    configured command whenever it wants to store or retrieve artifacts.
    A good use case is AWS S3 access by simply using the awscli. 
    It's somewhat slower compared to the http cache because it must spawn
    external commands but it does not need a proxy between Please and your
    storage.
  </p>

  <p>
    Enable read access by setting the
    <code class="code">retrievecommand</code> property in the
    <a class="copy-link" href="/config.html#cache"
      >cache section of the config</a
    >. 
    The configured command must be able to stream a tar file to stdout.
    Please sets the environment variable <code class="code">CACHE_KEY</code> 
    to the cache entries filename.
  </p>
  
  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    [Cache]
    retrievecommand = "cat /your/cache/$CACHE_KEY"
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    Write access is controlled by the
    <code class="code">storecommand</code> property.
    Keep it empty if you only want to have read-only access.
    The configured command must be able to read a tar file from stdin.
    Use the environment variable <code class="code">CACHE_KEY</code> 
    as a part of the filename so that Please can retrieve the 
    artifact by using the same key later.
  </p>

  <pre class="code-container">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <code data-lang="plz">
    [Cache]
    storecommand = "cat &gt; /your/cache/$CACHE_KEY"
    </code>
  </pre>
