<h1>Cross-compiling</h1>

<p>From v12.2 onwards, Please has cross-compilation support. This allows you to
  instruct it to build outputs for other architectures alongside the host architecture.</p>

<p>To target a different architecture, use the <code>--arch</code> flag when invoking plz.
  Architectures are formed of a two-part tags in a similar format to Go's - i.e.
  <code>linux_amd64</code> etc. These are passed in as a single flag but decomposed into
  separate OS and architecture parts for later operations. You can request whatever architecture
  you want, but obviously the build will not succeed unless you have tools that understand
  that architecture.</p>

<p>The outputs from a cross-compiled build will be in a directory under plz-out prefixed
  with the architecture - e.g. <code>plz-out/bin/linux_x86</code>,
  <code>plz-out/gen/darwin_amd64</code> etc.</p>

<h3>Technical notes</h3>

<p>Cross compilation is primarily achieved through global variables in the BUILD language. Build rules
  adjust their commands as necessary based on these values. When compiling a target for a different
  architecture, the BUILD file is re-parsed generating specialised rules for that architecture.

<p>The <code>CONFIG.ARCH</code> and <code>CONFIG.OS</code> properties will be set to the target
  architecture. Similarly, when the rule builds, the <code>OS</code> and <code>ARCH</code> environment
  variables will also be set. The <code>CONFIG.HOST_OS</code> and <code>CONFIG.HOST_ARCH</code> contain t
  he host machines operating system and CPU architecture.</p>

<p>The distinction between <code>tools</code> and other dependencies of a target
  (e.g. <code>src</code> or <code>deps</code>) is <b>extremely</b> important when cross-compiling.
  Dependencies of a rule typically behave as you'd hope. All dependencies except <code>tools</code>
  will use the target architecture unless explicitly told not to via a platform specific label e.g.
  <code>///linux_amd64//some/target</code>.</p>

<p>Tools, on the other hand, always use the host architecture since they are executed on
  the host during the build. In some cases tools might need to know the architecture they're
  targeting. To facilitate this, the target architecture is set in <code>CONFIG.TARGET_OS</code> and
  <code>CONFIG.TARGET_ARCH</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="config.html">config file</a> for any target architecture is read
  (if present) and applied for targets compiling for that architecture - e.g.
  <code>.plzconfig_linux_x86</code>. Typically you will need to create this file and
  modify the appropriate settings i.e. compiler flags.</p>

<h3>Language status</h3>

<p>The various builtin languages have differing levels of support. Currently they are as follows:</p>
<h4>C & C++</h4>
<p>Works for most cases; there is an example in the
  <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/tree/master/test/cross_compile">Please repo</a>
  which tests a simple amd64 -> x86 compilation.</p>
<p>You will need to alter the config file to make this work - see the
  <a href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/blob/master/.plzconfig_linux_x86">example for x86</a>
  for some examples of the settings to change. So far this has not been tested in anger on a more complex setup.</p>

<h4>Go</h4>
<p>Works well across all platforms supported by Go. When using
  <a href="/lexicon.html#go_toolchain">go_toolchain()</a> to manage your go installation, cross compilation works
  out of the box. </p>
<p>Otherwise you must ensure the standard library is available for the target architecture on
  the host machine via <code>GOOS="linux" GOARCH="386" go install -i std</code>.</p>

<h4>Python</h4>
<p>Currently has very limited support. Of course it will work
  for pure Python, however, binary modules built locally need a similar approach to C.</p>
<p>
  Binary third-party modules downloaded via <a href="lexicon.html#pip_library">pip_library</a> won't
  work since pip can't be instructed to use a different architecture.
  <a href="lexicon.html#python_wheel">python_wheel</a> works fine but requires something else
  to have built & hosted the .whl file.</p>

<h4>Java</h4>
<p>This is not terribly relevant to Java since it effectively always targets the same JVM architecture.
  <a href="lexicon.html#maven_jar">maven_jar</a> rules that specify <code>native = True</code> will
  download for the target architecture.</p>
<p>While not exactly related to this cross-compilation mechanism, there are also config options controlling
  the target, source and release level for <a href="/config.html#java">Java</a>.</p>
