<h1 class="title-1">Cross-compiling</h1>

<p>
  From v12.2 onwards, Please has cross-compilation support. This allows you to
  instruct it to build outputs for other architectures alongside the host
  architecture.
</p>

<p>
  To target a different architecture, use the
  <code class="code">--arch</code> flag when invoking plz. Architectures are
  formed of a two-part tags in a similar format to Go's - i.e.
  <code class="code">linux_amd64</code> etc. These are passed in as a single
  flag but decomposed into separate OS and architecture parts for later
  operations. You can request whatever architecture you want, but obviously the
  build will not succeed unless you have tools that understand that
  architecture.
</p>

<p>
  The outputs from a cross-compiled build will be in a directory under plz-out
  prefixed with the architecture - e.g.
  <code class="code">plz-out/bin/linux_x86</code>,
  <code class="code">plz-out/gen/darwin_amd64</code> etc.
</p>

  <h2 class="title-2">Technical notes</h2>

  <p>
    Cross compilation is primarily achieved through global variables in the
    BUILD language. Build rules adjust their commands as necessary based on
    these values. When compiling a target for a different architecture, the
    BUILD file is re-parsed generating specialised rules for that architecture.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code class="code">CONFIG.ARCH</code> and
    <code class="code">CONFIG.OS</code> properties will be set to the target
    architecture. Similarly, when the rule builds, the
    <code class="code">OS</code> and <code class="code">ARCH</code> environment
    variables will also be set. The <code class="code">CONFIG.HOST_OS</code> and
    <code class="code">CONFIG.HOST_ARCH</code> contain the host machines
    operating system and CPU architecture.
  </p>

  <p>
    The distinction between <code class="code">tools</code> and other
    dependencies of a target (e.g. <code class="code">src</code> or
    <code class="code">deps</code>) is <strong>extremely</strong> important when
    cross-compiling. Dependencies of a rule typically behave as you'd hope. All
    dependencies except <code class="code">tools</code>
    will use the target architecture unless explicitly told not to via a
    platform specific label e.g.
    <code class="code">///linux_amd64//some/target</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tools, on the other hand, always use the host architecture since they are
    executed on the host during the build. In some cases tools might need to
    know the architecture they're targeting. To facilitate this, the target
    architecture is set in <code class="code">CONFIG.TARGET_OS</code> and
    <code class="code">CONFIG.TARGET_ARCH</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a class="copy-link" href="/config.html">config file</a> for any target
    architecture is read (if present) and applied for targets compiling for that
    architecture - e.g. <code class="code">.plzconfig_linux_x86</code>.
    Typically you will need to create this file and modify the appropriate
    settings i.e. compiler flags.

  <h2 class="title-2">Language status</h2>

  <p>
    The various builtin languages have differing levels of support. Currently
    they are as follows:
  </p>

  <section class="mt4">
    <h3 class="title-3">C & C++</h3>

    <p>
      Works for most cases; there is an example in the
      <a
        class="copy-link"
        href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/tree/master/test/cross_compile"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        >Please repo</a
      >
      which tests a simple amd64 -&gt; x86 compilation.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will need to alter the config file to make this work - see the
      <a
        class="copy-link"
        href="https://github.com/thought-machine/please/blob/master/.plzconfig_linux_x86"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        >example for x86</a
      >
      for some examples of the settings to change. So far this has not been
      tested in anger on a more complex setup.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mt4">
    <h3 class="title-3">Go</h3>

    <p>
      Works well across all platforms supported by Go. When using
      <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#go_toolchain">go_toolchain()</a>
      to manage your go installation, cross compilation works out of the box.
    </p>

    <p>
      Otherwise you must ensure the standard library is available for the target
      architecture on the host machine via
      <code class="code">GOOS="linux" GOARCH="386" go install -i std</code>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mt4">
    <h3 class="title-3">Python</h3>

    <p>
      Currently has very limited support. Of course it will work for pure
      Python, however, binary modules built locally need a similar approach to
      C.
    </p>

    <p>
      Binary third-party modules downloaded via
      <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#pip_library">pip_library</a>
      won't work since pip can't be instructed to use a different architecture.
      <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#python_wheel">python_wheel</a>
      works fine but requires something else to have built &amp; hosted the .whl
      file.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mt4">
    <h3 class="title-3">Java</h3>

    <p>
      This is not terribly relevant to Java since it effectively always targets
      the same JVM architecture.
      <a class="copy-link" href="/lexicon.html#maven_jar">maven_jar</a>
      rules that specify <code class="code">native = True</code> will download
      for the target architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
      While not exactly related to this cross-compilation mechanism, there are
      also config options controlling the target, source and release level for
      <a class="copy-link" href="/config.html#java">Java</a>.
