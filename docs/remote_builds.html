<h1>Remote build execution</h1>

<p class="experimental">This feature is still experimental; some aspects may not work fully
  or at all just yet. Proceed with caution!</p>

<p>From v15 onwards, Please has the ability to submit build actions to remote executors.<br/>
  By default work is still executed on your local machine, but this means parallelism is
  fundamentally limited by the available local compute capacity; larger teams may want to
  improve overall speed with access to a larger pool of compute capacity. There are also
  a number of other considerable benefits such as being able to share artifacts globally
  between all executions (essentially ensuring each build action only happens once) and
  executing them in a more controlled environment.</p>

<p>Please makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis">Remote Execution API</a>
  to distribute work. This is a generic <a href="https://grpc.io">gRPC-based</a> API with
  a number of options for the server-side; see
  <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/blob/master/README.md">their documentation</a>
  for some more information.</p>

<p>The API is fairly involved and there are some requirements that the server must fulfil
  to work with plz. Setting it up can be a reasonable amount of work.<br/>
  A few things you might want to keep in mind are:
  <ul>
    <li>Please requires version 2.1 of the Remote Execution API (for the
      <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/pull/96">non-specific output path</a>
      field). At time of writing relatively few servers identify as this, but
      we hope they'll upgrade soon.</li>
    <li>Whatever tools you use off the system also have to be available on the server; if your
      build rule invokes <code>go</code> you have to have that on the PATH somewhere in both cases.</li>
    <li>You have to have plz installed on the agent to access the tools it comes with. You might
      need to customise the <code>remote.homedir</code> property to find it.</li>
  </ul>
  We're actively working on a nmber of things to make the above easier.</p>
