<h1 class="title-1">Remote build execution</h1>

<p class="red">
  This feature is still experimental; some aspects may not work fully or at all
  just yet. Proceed with caution!
</p>

<p>
  From v15 onwards, Please has the ability to submit build actions to remote
  executors.<br />
  By default work is still executed on your local machine, but this means
  parallelism is fundamentally limited by the available local compute capacity;
  larger teams may want to improve overall speed with access to a larger pool of
  compute capacity. There are also a number of other considerable benefits such
  as being able to share artifacts globally between all executions (essentially
  ensuring each build action only happens once) and executing them in a more
  controlled environment.

  to distribute work. This is a generic
  <a class="copy-link" href="https://grpc.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >gRPC-based</a

  API with a number of options for the server-side; see

  for some more information.

<p>
  The API is fairly involved and there are some requirements that the server
  must fulfil to work with plz. Setting it up can be a reasonable amount of
  work.<br />
  A few things you might want to keep in mind are:
</p>

<ul class="bulleted-list">
  <li>
    <span>
      Please requires version 2.1 of the Remote Execution API (for the
      <a

        >non-specific output path</a

      field). At time of writing relatively few servers identify as this, but we
      hope they'll upgrade soon.</span

  </li>
  <li>
    <span
      >Whatever tools you use off the system also have to be available on the
      server; if your build rule invokes <code class="code">go</code> you have
      to have that on the PATH on the remote.<br />
      This isn't needed if you use tools as other build rules though.</span
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      You have to have plz installed on the agent to access the tools it comes
      with. You might need to customise the
      <code class="code">remote.homedir</code> property to find it.</span

    <span>
      One of the remote servers will need to implement the
      <a

        >Remote Asset API</a
      >. This can be a different endpoint from the others but will be needed for
      any <code class="code">remote_file</code> rules to work.</span

  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  We're actively working on a nmber of things to make the above easier and
  expect it to evolve quite a bit over the next few versions.
