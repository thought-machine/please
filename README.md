Please is a cross-language build system with an emphasis on
high performance, extensibility and reproduceability.
It supports a number of popular languages and can automate
nearly any aspect of your build process.

See http://please.build for more information.

Currently Linux (tested on Ubuntu) and OSX are actively supported,
and FreeBSD is known to work with a little setup (see FAQ for details).


Getting Started
===============

The easiest way to install it on your own machine is to run:
```bash
curl -s https://get.please.build | bash
```
Or, if you prefer, grab one of the tarballs off our
[releases page](https://github.com/thought-machine/please/releases)
and extract it yourself; it typically lives in `~/.please`.

Then you simply run `plz init` at the root of your project to set up
a default config and you're good to start adding BUILD files.
See [the website](http://please.build) for more instructions about
how to write them.

There are various commands available to interact with Please, the
most obvious & useful ones initially are `plz build` and `plz test`
to build things & run tests respectively. See `plz --help` or the
[documentation](https://please.build/commands.html) for more comprehensive
information.


Building Please
===============

To build Please yourself, run `./bootstrap.sh` in the repo root.
This will set up the minimal environment needed to build Please,
build it once manually and then rebuild it again using itself.
You'll need to have Go 1.10+ installed to build Please although once
built it can target any version from 1.5+ onwards.

Optional dependencies for various tests include Python, Java, unittest++
(`sudo apt-get install libunittest++-dev`), clang, gold and docker - none
of those are required to build components so their tests will be excluded
if they aren't available.

If you'd rather not worry about installing the dependencies, we provide
a prebuilt Docker image based on Ubuntu which is capable of building
the whole thing for you:
[`docker run -it thoughtmachine/please_ubuntu`](https://hub.docker.com/r/thoughtmachine/please_ubuntu)

Status
======

Please is released & we consider it stable; we follow [semver](https://semver.org)
for releases, so major versions indicate potentially breaking changes to the
BUILD language, command line or other behaviour. We try to minimise this where
possible.

We're very happy to accept pull requests & feature requests, and bugs if it's
not working for you. We don't always have time for everything since Please is
only part-time work for us, but we'll do our best.
